<h1 id="final-scores">Final Scores</h1>

<p>Final scores can be found <a target="_blank" href="/scoresheet21"> here</a>. Blank tests, keys, and score distributions can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14inBI0VlhCqHEKUmLUQ6yHXLX1A15OC6?usp=sharing"> here</a>.</p>

<p>Previously, GGSO had the policy that all scores were final after the awards ceremony was over. However, due to the unique nature of Science Olympiad this year, <b>we have decided to implement a score review period after our awards ceremony</b>. After results are released after the awards ceremony, teams will have until <b>5 pm PT on Monday, February 22</b> to fill out <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfhfsXtF42fEbD3K8gOhaoQWXXQffd9qf8pcfdnEUfHVY9ghQ/viewform">this</a> form to tell us about any major result discrepancies (ex. Incorrect no-shows, DQs, clerical errors). The score review period will <b>NOT</b> be accepting any regrade requests for students contesting question rubrics. After this score review period, our results will be considered final.</p>

<p>Our awards ceremony can be found on Youtube <a href="https://youtu.be/gxqpG2aL6c0">here</a>. Graded copies of tests can now be found on Scilympiad.</p>

<p>Finally, please ask your teams to fill out our <a target="_blank" href="https://forms.gle/3UqeRXAv8WQ9y2DB6">tournament survey</a> if you have not done so already! After the awards ceremony, we will be providing PDF copies of tests and keys for all events to teams that have survey responses from at least one coach and one student.</p>

<p>Thank you to all the teams who participated in our tournament, and we hope to see everyone again (perhaps in person..?) next year!</p>

<h1 id="post-tournament-updates">Post-Tournament Updates</h1>

<p>Hello GGSO community,</p>

<p>With our awards ceremony only 2 days away, we would like to provide you with some updates.</p>

<p><b>Event Updates:</b> As the tournament progressed, we had to make some tough decisions based on feedback we received about certain events. As we already announced on tournament day, we have decided to make Write it CAD it a trial event due to the multiple issues teams had with Onshape.</p>

<p>During and directly after the tournament, we also received concerns from various teams about the Designer Genes event. It was brought to our attention that a significant portion of the test included questions that were directly taken from the BEARSO Invitational Designer Genes test earlier this season. We sincerely apologize for this oversight; this is against GGSO policy, as we require all our event supervisors to create new and unique questions for our tests. After extensive score analysis to determine how the re-used BEARSO questions affected the scores, <b>the board has decided to make Designer Genes a trial event</b>. We will still award medals to the top 10 teams, but Designer Genes will no longer count towards the official team score. We understand the time and effort that students have put into preparing for this event, but we sincerely believe that this decision is the most fair for all teams that competed at GGSO. Please let us know if you have questions or concerns about this decision, and again we offer our sincerest apologies and take full responsibility for this mistake.</p>

<p>To summarize, <b>there are now three trial events for GGSO (Biophysics, Write it CAD it, and Designer Genes)</b> that will receive medals for top 10 teams, but will not count towards the overall team score.</p>

<p><b>Awards Ceremony:</b> As a reminder, our awards ceremony will take place <b>Saturday, February 20th at 5 pm PT</b>. We will send out a link to the livestream Saturday morning.</p>

<p><b>Score Review:</b> Previously, GGSO had the policy that all scores were final after the awards ceremony was over. However, due to the unique nature of Science Olympiad this year, <b>we have decided to implement a score review period after our awards ceremony</b>. After results are released after the awards ceremony, teams will have until <b>5 pm PT on Monday, February 22</b> to fill out <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfhfsXtF42fEbD3K8gOhaoQWXXQffd9qf8pcfdnEUfHVY9ghQ/viewform">this</a> form to tell us about any major result discrepancies (ex. Incorrect no-shows, DQs, clerical errors). The score review period will <b>NOT</b> be accepting any regrade requests for students contesting question rubrics. After this score review period, our results will be considered final.</p>

<p><b>Social Media Contest:</b> The 2021 GGSO Social Media Contest is in full swing! Head on over to our social media platforms to participate in the biggest giveaway series we’ve ever had yet for a chance to win a <b>FREE 2021 GGSO T-shirt</b>! The steps for official entry are:</p>

<h3>February 14, 2021</h3>

<h1 id="post-tournament-recap">Post-Tournament Recap</h1>

<p>Hello GGSO community,</p>

<p>We were so pleased to have you join us for the fifth annual (and first virtual!) GGSO tournament this past weekend, and we want to offer a huge congratulations to all our coaches, competitors, and volunteers!</p>

<p><b>Feedback:</b> Now that the tournament is over, we’d like to collect your thoughts about how it went: good, bad, annoying, wonderful. We ask that at least one coach and one student from each participating team fills out the feedback survey <a target="_blank" href="https://forms.gle/oZKWBokDJ7yx7mE6A">here</a>. When at least one student and one coach have completed this form, a folder with the tests and score distributions will be shared with the team. We would really appreciate the chance to hear your thoughts in order to improve the experience, which we hope can be held in person next year.</p>

<p><b>Events:</b> Write It Cad It <b>has become a trial event</b> for this GGSO invitational tournament and its results will not be counted toward the team total. Updates on other events, if any, will come in the following days.</p>

<p><b>T-shirts:</b> T-shirts are still on sale! The order deadline has been extended through <b>11:59 PM PST on Sunday, February 14th</b>. T-shirts are $16 dollars each and you can order them directly <a target="_blank" href="https://www.customink.com/g/nga0-00cd-6nfk">here</a>. Orders will be shipped directly to you by CustomInk two weeks after, in early March. You are responsible for covering the shipping costs, so we encourage teams to place orders together to reduce the cost of shipping.</p>

<p>Once again, we are extremely sorry for all the inconveniences that you may have experienced and we appreciate you being patient with us. We thank you and congratulate you on your achievements in STEM and Science Olympiad, and we hope you will consider joining us again next year!</p>

<p>If you have any questions, feel free to email us at goldengatescioly@gmail.com!</p>

<p>Best wishes, <br />
The GGSO Team</p>

<h3>February 13, 2021</h3>

<h1 id="day-of-updates">Day Of Updates</h1>

<h2 id="update-5">Update 5:</h2>
<p>We thank you again for your patience as we deal with all of the issues associated with Write It CAD It. Due to all the issues that arose as a result of the Onshape crash this morning, we will be making Write It CAD It a trial event. The score will not factor into overall team placement, however, we will still be handing out medals for the event. Again, sorry for all the issues with this event.</p>

<h2 id="update-4">Update 4:</h2>
<p>We thank you for your patience as we deal with all of the issues associated with Write It CAD It. It appears that Onshape crashed at the beginning of the CAD-er’s time slot, causing multiple teams to not have the full 20 minutes to complete the build. If this was the case for your team, please email the event supervisors (ixxia@stanford.edu and nicolexin@berkeley.edu), and we will grant extensions. For teams that need extensions, we will be manually opening the CAD-er event after 1 PM PST, after which the CAD-er will have a 20 minute time-block to continue their build, which they can start anytime during the day. <strong>Please only use the amount of time you lost during the actual event</strong> (i.e. if you were able to CAD for 10 minutes during the event, use only 10 minutes of the extension time). The CAD-er will have access to the writer’s instructions during that time.</p>

<p>To clarify, all teams that have reached out to us asking for extensions will be receiving an extension on the CAD-er’s end – we just haven’t had the capacity to reply to every email. We have also had some issues with the writer’s instructions not saving – unfortunately, this is a persistent issue with Scilympiad and we will not be able to grant exceptions.</p>

<h2 id="update-3">Update 3:</h2>
<p>We apologize for all Write It CAD It issues. Our event supervisors will be reviewing all issues and time extension requests on a case by case basis. If your team were not able to upload files, please email Iris Xia (ixxia@stanford.edu) or Nicole Xin (nicolexin@berkeley.edu).</p>

<p>Additionally, some schools have reached out to us that one team has already taken a Block 1 event (Detector Building, Digital Structures, and Biophysics) but their other team was not able to take it yet. If a school has more than one team, both teams should take the block 1 events at the same time. If this is not possible, teams may take it at different times but will be held to higher scrutiny and additional review. The latest time that teams can take a test affected by a time extension/rescheduling is 6:00pm PT, please reach out to us if this is infeasible for your teams.</p>

<p>If you are still facing problems or have any questions, please feel free to contact us with your team numbers and which events you are facing problems with.</p>

<h2 id="update-2">Update 2:</h2>
<p>Thank you for your patience as we have worked to resolve all the technical difficulties this morning. We have an update for the time slots for block 1 events.</p>

<p>Block 1 events (Detector Building, Digital Structures, and Biophysics) may be started at its designated rescheduled time block (from <strong>4:10pm - 5:10pm PT</strong>) or <strong>at any time before 4:10pm</strong>. Teams no longer need to email us to ask to take it earlier in the day. Please note that only during the rescheduled time block, event supervisors will be present, so we highly recommend that students take the exam during that block. In the case that competitors are unable to compete at that time block, they may take it at an earlier time (but the event supervisor will not be there). If a school has more than one team, both teams must take the block 1 events at the same time in order to ensure fairness (or else teams risk being disqualified).</p>

<p>If you are still facing problems or have any questions, please feel free to contact us with your team numbers and which events you are facing problems with.</p>

<h2 id="update-1">Update 1:</h2>
<p>We are sorry for all the inconveniences that Scilympiad has caused. As of now, we believe we have fixed the issue and would like to let you all know that you should do the following right now before students go on to take their next event:</p>

<p>Log out of Scilympiad and restart your browser to make sure that changes on Scilympiad are reflected.
Log back into your Scilympiad account and you may start your Block 2 events.
If that doesn’t work, try going to your browser’s history and resetting cookies and do step 2.</p>

<p>Since the block 1 events (Detector Building, Digital Structures, and Biophysics) had issues, we have created a new time block for the block 1 events <strong>(from 4:10pm - 5:10pm PT)</strong>. During this new time block, event supervisors will be present. If you can’t do the block 1 events’ tests at this time, please <strong>contact us and let us know which times during the day that you are available</strong>, and we will grant students a time to take the test. If a school has more than one team, both teams must take the block 1 events at the same time in order to ensure fairness. Also, if you are unable to take the block 1 events at the 4:10pm - 5:10pm PT time block, we cannot guarantee that there will be event supervisors during the time that you take the tests at.</p>

<p>Moreover, we have extended the submission deadline for the team rosters, so if you need to make any last minute changes, you are free to do so.</p>

<p>If you are still facing problems or have any questions, please feel free to contact us with your team numbers and which events you are facing problems with.</p>

<h3>February 12, 2021</h3>

<h1 id="final-reminders">Final Reminders</h1>

<p>Hello GGSO community,</p>

<p>I hope you all have been doing well! The Golden Gate Science Olympiad tournament is tomorrow (Saturday 2/13), so here are some last reminders:</p>

<p><b>Important Info:</b> All up-to-date information can be found on our GGSO 2021 Plan <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PgulkUgZ8pOl2daWdRuLzUSWo5lmfeKH7uJjoBNgBtk/edit">doc</a>.</p>

<p><b>Scilympiad Action Items (Students):</b> Please ensure that all students have access to Scilympiad and can log in using their Login IDs <b>before the tournament tomorrow</b>. Any issues with login should be resolved before the tournament. Please note that students no longer have the option to use their email address to sign into Scilympiad; they must use their login IDs. Students must also turn in their waiver/release forms prior to tournament day (by <b>February 12, 11:59 pm PT</b>) in order to compete.</p>

<p><b>Scilympiad Action Items (Coaches):</b> Student rosters should be finalized on Scilympiad by this same deadline (<b>February 12, 11:59 pm PT</b>). Coaches, remember that you must add students to teams and events on Scilympiad in order for students to take tests on tournament day. To clarify some questions we’ve received about our trial event, Biophysics, <b>teams are allowed to add alternates on Scilympiad and assign them to the event</b>.

<h3>February 08, 2021</h3>

<h1 id="february-updates">February Updates</h1>

<p>With the tournament one week away, we would like to provide you with one more update.</p>

<p><b>Waivers:</b> Several teams have reached out about the student waiver/release forms. We apologize for the confusion, but to clarify, our tournament is only requiring one release form to be signed per student, which can be found in the “Release Forms” section of the Head Coach Dashboard. We have also now activated the “Verification/Checklist” function on the coach dashboard, so you can check which students have submitted their release forms. Students must turn in their forms prior to <b>February 12, 11:59 pm PT</b> in order to compete.</p>

<p><b>Student Rosters:</b> Student rosters should be finalized on Scilympiad by <b>February 12, 11:59 pm PT</b>. Coaches must add students to teams and events on Scilympiad in order for students to take tests on tournament day. To clarify some questions we’ve received about our trial event, Biophysics, teams are allowed to add alternates on Scilympiad and assign them to this event. Details on how to do this, as well as other helpful tips, can be found in the Scilympiad Head Coach Reference Guide <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C89iAxOcoc6cH4OIqX9pm5p88cta7X6931HrJCgmOeY/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Scilympiad Login Update:</b> A recent Scilympiad update has made it so students will no longer have the option to sign in to their Scilympiad account through email. Students must sign in using their login IDs (automatically assigned when they register their account). If coaches or students are having trouble finding these login IDs or signing in to Scilympiad, please refer to the coaches reference guide above or email us.</p>

<p><b>Notes Submission:</b> As mentioned previously, we have made a Google Form through which students will submit their note sheets before the event starts, found <a target="_blank" href="https://forms.gle/3MENf7XUx1spKtDt6">here</a>. This form is intended only for events with a limited number of notes sheets; binder events do not require a submission. Please make one submission per team per event. If you update your notes, you should resubmit your note sheet to this form; we will only check the latest submission. All copies of the cheat sheets submitted will be deleted after the awards ceremony.</p>

<p><b>Awards Ceremony:</b> Awards will be taking place on <b>February 20, 2021</b> at <b>5 pm PT</b>. The schedule is linked <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yu9vtbaEITvUqZculFzEZIy6IVRowMNpLhBmWEn2j20/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Troubleshooting:</b> With this new format, communication between teams and tournament directors can be difficult. This year, GGSO will have a Zoom link open from <b>7:30 am - 4:30 pm PT</b> on tournament day for any urgent questions/concerns <a target="_blank" href="https://stanford.zoom.us/j/93917725257?pwd=WmpCL1dOWkdzbzdxN1JFMHBMd1B1UT09">here</a> (password: 021321). This Zoom link is for coaches only - students should direct their questions to event supervisors and/or coaches first. Students and coaches can refer to our Day-of Tournament Troubleshooting guide (found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RwFu7o9ulwN38wOhzgiJbcd3WqxK6dKm0yXTlSPJzYQ/edit?fbclid=IwAR1_L41ff1XKi-vKV7voq7AktFOgg0jxx70B5MyLgQWacAdy-P2j6xpWQ9g">here</a>) for common solutions to technical problems before contacting tournament directors. For any event-specific challenges/concerns, coaches can file an online appeal through Scilympiad as usual.</p>

<p><b>Academic Integrity:</b> We have also created an academic integrity guide for both students and coaches to read, found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p-SrlxuggYGClG7R8Vz__0jYUTTMuQNCSHoSG7tRr14/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. Please make sure to read it in its entirety as it details our investigation procedures in the event that we suspect cheating has occurred. All communication with teams regarding academic integrity will be done through coaches, so please be sure to monitor your email regularly and respond in a timely manner if we have any inquiries.</p>

<p><b>T-shirts:</b> GGSO T-shirts are now on sale! T-shirts are $16 dollars each and can be ordered directly <a target="_blank" href="https://www.customink.com/g/nga0-00cd-6nfk">here</a>. Orders may be placed until competition day and will be shipped directly to you by CustomInk two weeks after in early March. You are responsible for covering the shipping costs, so we encourage teams to place orders together to reduce the cost of shipping.</p>

<p><b>Sponsors:</b> We would like to thank our sponsors for helping make this tournament possible: Stanford School of Earth, Energy, and Environmental Sciences, Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Chemical and Systems Biology at Stanford, and Professional Engineers in California Government.</p>

<p>All of these updates are reflected in our detailed <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PgulkUgZ8pOl2daWdRuLzUSWo5lmfeKH7uJjoBNgBtk/edit">plan</a>. Please refer to this document for the most up-to-date information.</p>

<h3>January 25, 2021</h3>

<h1 id="january-updates">January Updates</h1>

<p>Hello GGSO community,</p>

<p>I hope you all have been doing well! With the tournament right around the corner, we would like to provide you with several tournament updates and reminders.</p>

<p><b>Team Numbers:</b> We have assigned team numbers on <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15S0l71y05jJcq5jR_tgCBhPnlH0wrfs-f_nUiTHpQqs/edit?usp=sharing">this</a> sheet and you should now be able to assign competitors to teams and events on Scilympiad. Please note that student rosters and release forms are due before competition day on <b>February 13, 2021</b>; students will not be able to compete without having these completed.</p>

<p><b>T-shirt Contest:</b> Congratulations to Jackie Chiang from Milpitas High School for winning our T-shirt design competition! We had many stand-out submissions that were entered, so thank you to all those who submitted their amazing designs! GGSO T-shirts with her design are now on sale! T-shirts are $16 dollars each and you can order them directly on CustomInk <a target="_blank" href="https://www.customink.com/g/nga0-00cd-6nfk">here</a>. Orders may be placed through Sunday of competition weekend on <b>February 13th, 2021</b> and will be shipped directly to you by CustomInk two weeks after, in early March. You are responsible for covering the shipping costs, so we encourage teams to place orders together to reduce the cost of shipping.</p>

<p><b>Event Schedule:</b> Just as a reminder, this year we will not be having event self sign-ups. Each event already has a designated time slot and the schedule can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XhhFDybp2RPfqP_s_4udwhTCQWXFlkmDZoc5O-3EYFg/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Write It, CAD It:</b> The software that we will be using for Write It, CAD It is <b>Onshape</b>. Teams will need to make their own accounts using the student version, which is free. <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mO0YaPh-shvcu6__tcI2rao-bZNPwDqEnX4w9iph3qY/edit?usp=sharing">Here</a> are instructions on how to set up an Onshape account and a more detailed event description. After setting up your account, coaches should make sure to individually assign their Writers and CAD-ers for the Write It, CAD It events. There are two events set up for it on Scilympiad, one for each partner, so one student should be assigned to each role.</p>

<p><b>Academic Integrity:</b> Ensuring the academic integrity of our tournament is of utmost importance. For this reason, we are requiring students to <b>upload a PDF copy</b> of their cheat sheet(s) online through Google Forms <b>before the start of the corresponding event block.</b> This form will be released at a later time. This only applies to events with a limited number of cheat sheets (binders do not need to be submitted). Students will be able to have their own copy of their cheat sheets/binders for each event provided that each student’s copy is identical. Students will be allowed to view cheat sheets and binders on an electronic device, but students will <b>NOT</b> be allowed to use any other resources not outlined in the official rules.</p>

<p>We will continue to update our detailed <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PgulkUgZ8pOl2daWdRuLzUSWo5lmfeKH7uJjoBNgBtk/edit">plan</a>, where you will find the most up-to-date information.</p>

<h1 id="2021-tournament-announcement">2021 Tournament Announcement</h1>

<p>Hello GGSO Community,</p>

<p>We’re excited to announce that the 2021 GGSO Invitational will be taking place on <b>Saturday, February 13th, 2021</b>! The tournament will follow the MiniSO model, which allows students to participate from their own homes. After a detailed consideration of participant feedback and NSO guidelines, we’ve concluded that this format is the most practical and safe for this year.</p>

<p>Important highlights include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Official team registration opens on Scilympiad on <b>Monday, October 5th</b> at Noon PDT on a first-come first-served basis at <a target="_blank" href="https://scilympiad.com/golden-gate">this</a> link. The registration fee will be $50, due by <b>November 20, 2020</b>. Please contact us if the registration fee poses a challenge for your team.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tournament will have a maximum of 150 competing teams, and a maximum of 2 teams allowed per school.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will be holding all Division C events allowed in the MiniSO model following regional-level rules. All tests will be administered in a synchronous form according to the PDT time zone. Students residing in other time zones are also welcome to participate, but will need to adhere to these times.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Events will be held on the <b>Scilympiad</b> platform, which allows partners to work simultaneously on tests. We also encourage partners to work together through other virtual platforms (ex. Phone call, video conferencing, etc.) but teams will not be allowed to gather in-person.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Details for team registration, who to mail checks to, and general information regarding how the tournament will operate can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PgulkUgZ8pOl2daWdRuLzUSWo5lmfeKH7uJjoBNgBtk/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. This document contains our detailed plans for the tournament and will be updated throughout the season. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!</p>

<h1 id="supporting-black-students-and-scientists">Supporting Black Students and Scientists</h1>

<center><img src="/img/announcements/BLM.png" height="100%" width="90%" /></center>

<p>155 years ago from this day, federal orders were announced in Texas proclaiming that all slaves in the state were now free. On June 19th, 1865, the first ever Juneteenth took place, marking the emancipation of all slaves in the Confederacy.</p>

<p>Juneteenth commemorates the end of slavery in the United States, celebrating the freedom and autonomy of Black Americans. But the fight for justice is far from over. White supremacy, systemic racism, and institutional oppression continue to be tragically prominent realities of American life, and the unjustifiable killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, David McAtee, Mike Ramos, Tony McDade, and countless others at the hands of police brutality bring attention to the glaring racial injustices woven into our system at its core. The time for change is long overdue.</p>

<p>We at Golden Gate Science Olympiad are committed to broadening the horizons of STEM education across the nation’s many communities and diverse backgrounds. But this cannot be achieved while inequity continues to permeate our nation’s very structure and its governing institutions. It is our duty, as allies, to listen to, elevate, and empower Black voices and communities in any way that we can, and to be actively anti-racist in all that we do.</p>

<p>It would be complicit of us to disregard the severe lack of BIPOC representation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields within the United States. The realm of STEM education has a history of being an inaccessible and exclusionary space, undoubtedly playing its role in a broken system built to obstruct the mobility of BIPOC within this country. And there is no room for complacency in a broken system.</p>

<p>GGSO pledges to match all donations, up to $300, to the following national organizations dedicated to supporting Black and African American higher education and STEM-oriented U.S. organizations. Please send us screenshots of your donations to goldengatescioly@gmail.com, and we will provide receipts of the matched donations once completed.</p>
