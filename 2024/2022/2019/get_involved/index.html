<p>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has a mission of strengthening the United States’ security by developing and applying world-class science, technology and engineering that enhances the nation’s defense, reduces the global threat from terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, and responds with vision, quality, integrity and technical excellence to scientific issues of national importance.</p>

<p><br />
<img class="sponsor" src="/img/sponsor/berkeley_mcb.gif" /></p>
<p>The UC Berkeley Department of Molecular & Cell Biology (MCB) is home to Undergraduate and Graduate academic programs as well as Faculty Research performed by faculty organized in five divisions: Biochemistry, Biophysics and Structural Biology; Cell and Developmental Biology; Genetics, Genomics and Development; Immunology and Pathogenesis; and Neurobiology. As a department, we are committed to supporting all our members and increasing the representation of historically under-represented groups in our community.</p>

<p><br />
<img class="sponsor" src="/img/sponsor/berkeley_bioengineering.png" /></p>
<p>Consistently ranked in the Top 10 according to US News & World Report, Bioengineering at Berkeley seeks to define the new discipline of bioengineering by concentrating on cutting-edge research and the training of advanced undergraduate and graduate students to be the next leaders in the field.</p>

<div class="col-lg-12" id ="volunteer">
<h1>Volunteer</h1>
<p>The competition only runs smoothly because of the talent and hard work of our many, many volunteers throughout the process. Volunteering can be the fun, day-long adventure of assisting with a tournament event—time and test building events, or score and grade the written tests, and more—or the more-involved commitment of an events supervisor. As an events supervisor, you get the chance to write the test and/or be in the ‘room where it happens’ on the day of the event, influencing the way students will display the knowledge they have worked so hard to cultivate. Whatever volunteering commitment you decide is right for you, it is bound to happen that you will learn something: and lifelong learning and curiosity is something GGSO certainly supports.
<strong>Applications for event supervisors and test committee members open in the fall [Note: Closed on 10/5/18 for the 2019 tournament], but we take general volunteers on a rolling basis!</strong>
</p>
<p>Click <a href="/volunteer/"> here</a> for more details.</p>
</div>

<div class="col-lg-12" id ="exec_board">
<h1>Executive Board</h1>
<p>Looking for an additional leadership role and more teamwork and involvement yet? Being part of the executive board for the GGSO Team puts you right in the center of the planning. With roles as diverse as Finance and Communications, Special Projects to Sponsorship, there is a place for a wide variety of personal experiences. If you have participated in Science Olympiad in the past and thought you might not get the chance to play an important role after high school graduation, being part of the Executive Board is a great way to involve yourself further and make a difference in how tournaments are designed and run.</p>
<p>Applications will open in the spring.

<p>Bioengineering applies engineering principles and practices to living things, to solve some of the most challenging problems that face our world today. The Department of Bioengineering at UC Berkeley seeks to define the new discipline of bioengineering by concentrating on cutting-edge research and the training of advanced undergraduate and graduate students to be the next leaders in the field. Consistently ranked in the Top 10 according to US News &amp; World Report, Bioengineering at Berkeley draws on the talents of a diverse group of outstanding faculty, and upon the long history of interdisciplinary bioengineering research at UC Berkeley. The department has programs at the undergraduate, professional master, and doctoral levels.</p>

<p>Stanford’s Office of Science Outreach (OSO) encourages and assists Stanford faculty and students to engage in science outreach targeted at our nation’s youth, school teachers, and general public that will increase their interest, understanding, and involvement in science, math, and engineering. Reporting to Stanford’s Dean of Research, the OSO helps faculty and students create outreach project ideas and proposals with which to share their research. We identify potential partners (both within Stanford as well as K-14 schools, nonprofits, science museums, etc.), assist with proposal development and project implementation, and maintain the OSO website to advertise what’s on offer.</p>

<p>Stanford ChEM-H is a new interdisciplinary institute focused on connecting Chemistry, Engineering, and Medicine for Human Health. The institute is a joint venture of the Schools of Medicine, Engineering, and Humanities and Sciences. The proximity of world-class biologists, chemists, engineers, and clinicians at Stanford presents a unique opportunity to study human biology at a molecular level, to translate this knowledge into groundbreaking products and services that promote healthy living, and to educate a new cadre of “physician-scientist-engineers” who will lead a rapidly evolving industry.</p>
