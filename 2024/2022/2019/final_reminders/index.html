<p>The Golden Gate Science Olympiad tournament is TOMORROW, and we’re looking forward to welcoming you at Berkeley.</p>

<p>For any last-minute questions or concerns (Friday evening/during the day Saturday), the best person to contact is Faith. She can be reached at 701-595-4054.</p>

<p>This post is edited to contain updated announcements in later emails. This post contains announcements from 2/1/19, 2/6/19, and 2/8/19.</p>

<h2 id="2819-reminders">2/8/19 Reminders:</h2>

<p>Check-in begins at <strong>8 a.m. in Kerr Lobby</strong>. Bus parking is first-come first-serve at <strong>West Circle/Crescent</strong> parking, and there is also street parking and parking garages all marked on the maps included below.</p>

<p>Team homerooms open by <strong>8:15 a.m. and close at 5:20 p.m</strong>. To see your homeroom, as well as event locations, please visit <a href="/doc/maps_2019.pdf">this link</a>, keeping in mind there are multiple tabs to the spreadsheet:</p>

<p>We expect rain on the day of the tournament; please keep this in mind when transporting event materials for impound. While food is NOT allowed in homerooms, <strong>teams may eat together on the ground floor of the MLK building and Eshleman Hall first floor ONLY. Food cannot be brought into Kerr Lobby, Pauley, Stephens Lounge, Tilden, etc.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Protein Modeling National SciOly Clarification:</strong> We would like to let coaches know that <strong>MSOE recently changed the grading rubric</strong> of Protein Modeling from 40/30/30 (prebuilds/onsite/test) to 20/40/40 due to issues with their prebuild rubric. We will be using this new rubric for our event as well.</p>

<p>In Kerr Lobby we will also have an awesome handmade photobooth for students to pose with. Please also follow our other social media accounts, where we’ll post fun tournament photos, updates, and live stories throughout the day to Snapchat <strong><a href="https://snapchat.com/add/ggscioly">(ggscioly)</a></strong>, Instagram <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/goldengatescioly/">(goldengatescioly)</a></strong> and Twitter <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/goldengateso">(@goldengateso)</a></strong>. Check us out!</p>

<p>We are also pleased to announce our keynote speaker, <strong>Dr. Joshua Hug</strong>. Dr. Joshua Hug is an Assistant Teaching Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at UC Berkeley. He teaches some of the largest computer science and data science courses at Berkeley, including Data Structures and Principles and Techniques of Data Science. He also conducts computer science education research. In 2017, he won the Diane S. McEntyre Award for Excellence in Teaching Computer Science.</p>

<p><strong>If you haven’t already, please remind to sign up for Remind 101. Remind 101 is how we will communicate with coaches tomorrow, rather than through emails.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Remind 101 service [share with students]</strong>: We use this text message remind service to send out critical day-of updates aimed primarily at coaches, but we encourage any students and parents to sign up to stay updated as well. Phone numbers are kept completely confidential by the website service, we promise not to send any updates after the tournament, and you can opt out at any time. <strong>Our Remind101 system code is @428ce7 this year, and you can join by texting @428ce7 to the number 81010.</strong></p>

<h2 id="2619-reminders">2/6/19 Reminders:</h2>

<p><strong>Remind 101 service [share with students]</strong>: We use this text message remind service to send out critical day-of updates aimed primarily at coaches, but we encourage any students and parents to sign up to stay updated as well. Phone numbers are kept completely confidential by the website service, we promise not to send any updates after the tournament, and you can opt out at any time. <strong>Our Remind101 system code is @428ce7 this year, and you can join by texting @428ce7 to the number 81010.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Forecast:</strong> We want coaches to be aware that the current weather forecast is predicting possible rain on the day of the tournament. Please prepare accordingly, especially for events which require the transportation of impound creations. See the weather forecast <a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/us/berkeley-ca/94704/daily-weather-forecast/332044?day=4">here</a> for more specific information:</p>

<p><strong>Video</strong>: We have an awesome pre-tournament video uploaded here. Please watch and share with students as well!</p>

<p><strong>Wright Stuff dimensions</strong>: A rule mandates that all competitors for the event Wright Stuff must be provided with the dimensions of the room in which this event will take place. This room is called the RSF Fieldhouse, and its dimensions are: <strong>180’ X 114’</strong>, with a ceiling height of 30’.</p>

<p><strong>Admissions panel:</strong> The day schedule (below) includes information about the admissions panel. This panel is a special students-only event at 4 p.m. Saturday where Berkeley students will discuss student life, academics, and choosing Berkeley.</p>

<p><strong>When to arrive:</strong> Please also remember that check-in begins at 8 a.m. in Kerr Lobby. We look forward to meeting you then!</p>

<h2 id="2119-reminders">2/1/19 Reminders:</h2>

<p><strong>Food Regulation Reminder:</strong> <strong>NO FOOD IS ALLOWED IN HOMEROOMS.</strong> We agree that this is a ridiculous and frustrating rule, but Berkeley’s Event Services has alerted us several times that custodians will be on patrol through our reserved areas. Similar student groups have faced <strong>fines on the order of $5000</strong> for violating this rule. We’re hoping for great weather on Saturday, so we recommend a nice lunch outside or encourage students to visit any of the many cafes highlighted in the maps on our website.</p>

<p>Please consider the homerooms as a place to study and store equipment, but not a place to eat. Custodians will be passing by rooms as well as checking trash cans. No food should be brought back to or disposed of in homerooms.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we feel obligated to enforce this rule harshly, since a university violation would prevent future GGSO tournaments from being possible (and violating schools may share financial burden of any fines). Teams with food in their homerooms and trash cans face possible point deductions on their score and blacklisting from future GGSO events. We deeply apologize for this inconvenience but hope that it’s not too troublesome.</p>

<p><strong>Morning Check-in:</strong> Please check in to receive your coach packet (which includes last-minute information, maps, and student wristbands). <strong>Check-in will be run in Kerr Lobby, beginning at 8 a.m.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Campus Map:</strong> We have an awesome digital map to aid in directions this year. Find it <a href="https://tinyurl.com/ggso19-map">here</a> or on our website under details. Please share this map with your teams as well. For additional navigation purposes, including walking to home rooms, events, and food locations, we recommend Google Maps. Previous tournament competitors have found this helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Wifi:</strong> Free wifi is available on campus (connect to CalVisitor).</p>

<p><strong>Homerooms:</strong> See <a href="/doc/maps_2019.pdf">here</a> to check which homeroom your team has been assigned to–as well as the event locations. There are multiple tabs to the spreadsheet. These homerooms open by 8:15am.</p>

<p><strong>Car Parking and Food:</strong> Please check for parking at any of the locations in the <a href="/doc/parking_map.pdf">parking map</a>. Note that some may require a daily fee. Food options we like can be found in <a href="/doc/food_options.pdf">this document</a>. Parking and food locations can also be found on our custom digital map.</p>

<p><strong>T-shirts [share with students]</strong>: Last year there was huge demand for GGSO t-shirts that are otherwise reserved for volunteers. This year, we ordered some extra for competitors! A limited number of shirts will be available for $15 in Kerr Lobby during the tournament, beginning at 10 a.m. (cash or check only).</p>

<p><strong>Awards ceremony:</strong> The awards ceremony will open to teams at 5:30 p.m. in Pauley Ballroom. <strong>Due to space constraints, chairs are reserved for competitors only.</strong> A seating chart will be provided. The awards ceremony will conclude by 7:30 p.m., when coaches can then pick up tournament exams and score sheets from Tilden in MLK.</p>

<p><strong>Remind 101 service [share with students]:</strong> We use this text message remind service to send out critical day-of updates aimed primarily at coaches, but we encourage any students and parents to sign up to stay updated as well. Phone numbers are kept completely confidential by the website service, we promise not to send any updates after the tournament, and you can opt out at any time. An email at a later date will include the information for Remind101 set-up for coaches and interested students and parents.</p>

<p><strong>Day and event schedule:</strong> An event schedule can be found <a href="/doc/event_schedule.pdf">here</a> and a general day schedule for the tournament has been posted online <a href="/doc/day_schedule.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Phone number:</strong> If any issues arise during check-in or during the tournament, please contact Faith at 701-595-4054.</p>

<p><strong>Social Media [Share with Students]:</strong> We’re online! We’ll be posting fun tournament photos, updates, and live stories throughout the day to our Snapchat <strong><a href="https://snapchat.com/add/ggscioly">(ggscioly)</a></strong> and Instagram <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/goldengatescioly/">(goldengatescioly)</a></strong> accounts, as well as Twitter <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/goldengateso">(@goldengateso)</a></strong>.
