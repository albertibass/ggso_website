<div class="col-lg-12" id ="volunteer">
<h1>Volunteer</h1>
<p>The competition only runs smoothly because of the talent and hard work of our many, many volunteers throughout the process. Volunteering can be the fun, day-long adventure of assisting with a tournament event—time and test building events, or score and grade the written tests, and more—or the more-involved commitment of an events supervisor. As an events supervisor, you get the chance to write the test and/or be in the ‘room where it happens’ on the day of the event, influencing the way students will display the knowledge they have worked so hard to cultivate. Whatever volunteering commitment you decide is right for you, it is bound to happen that you will learn something: and lifelong learning and curiosity is something GGSO certainly supports.
<strong>Applications for general volunteers <a target="_blank" href="/volunteer">are open now!</a></strong>

<div class="col-lg-12" id ="exec_board">
<h1>Executive Board</h1>
<p>Looking for an additional leadership role and more teamwork and involvement yet? Being part of the executive board for the GGSO Team puts you right in the center of the planning. With roles as diverse as Finance and Communications, Special Projects to Sponsorship, there is a place for a wide variety of personal experiences. If you have participated in Science Olympiad in the past and thought you might not get the chance to play an important role after high school graduation, being part of the Executive Board is a great way to involve yourself further and make a difference in how tournaments are designed and run.</p>
<p>Applications will open in the spring.
