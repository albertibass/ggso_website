<h3>February 11, 2022</h3>

<h1 id="final-updates">Final Updates</h1>

<p>Hello GGSO community,</p>

<p>I hope you all have been doing well! The Golden Gate Science Olympiad tournament is tomorrow (Saturday 2/12), so here are some final reminders:</p>

<p><b>Important Info:</b> All up-to-date information can be found on our GGSO 2022 Tournament Information <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q0Bj58jJeTsfraQjAVHoKzkRsz8YTwK1HTwxmNS8Bhw/edit?usp=sharing">document</a>. Please share this with all your students. Additionally, please review the event modification <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/15s4beEAVf4fmfHdjErVZjvQpTJpAtw2PjXpSSTBUjcE/edit">document</a> for any updates to events and to ensure you have all the necessary materials.</p>

<p><b>Scilympiad Action Items (Students):</b> Please ensure that all students have access to Scilympiad and can log in using their Login IDs before the tournament tomorrow. Any issues with login should be resolved before the tournament. Students <b>must also turn in their waiver/release forms prior to tournament day (by February 11, 11:59 pm PT) in order to compete</b>. Additionally, if you have not already done so, please fill out and scan the additional Satellite Science Olympiad School Use Agreement and upload the form on Scilympiad under Documents.</p>

<p><b>Scilympiad Action Items (Coaches):</b> Student rosters should be finalized on Scilympiad by this same deadline (<b>February 11, 11:59 pm PT</b>). Coaches, remember that you must add students to teams and events on Scilympiad in order for students to take tests on tournament day.</p>

<p><b>Time Zones:</b> Please note that all event schedules have times listed in Pacific Time. If your time zone is different, ensure that your students are aware of the respective time in your current time zone.</p>

<p><b>Emergency Contact:</b> Should you have any urgent questions on the day of the tournament, coaches (no students) may join <a target="_blank" href="https://stanford.zoom.us/j/95327809173?pwd=amt4V0tLbVd0eUN6Q215UG5YNjdUUT09">this</a> Zoom meeting. The zoom will be open from <b>8:30 am - 4:30 pm</b>. Students and coaches can refer to our Day-of Tournament Troubleshooting <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RwFu7o9ulwN38wOhzgiJbcd3WqxK6dKm0yXTlSPJzYQ/edit?fbclid=IwAR1_L41ff1XKi-vKV7voq7AktFOgg0jxx70B5MyLgQWacAdy-P2j6xpWQ9g">guide</a> for common solutions to technical problems before contacting tournament directors. For any event-specific challenges/concerns, coaches can file an online appeal through Scilympiad as usual.</p>

<p><b>Cheat Sheet Submission:</b> Remind your students to submit a copy of their cheat sheets <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScoLfXyobbrVx_c7daJT-W_VKhWHYiOkBinZooGh70OcFd5Og/viewform">here</a> <b>BEFORE the tournament starts!</b> This form is intended only for events with a limited number of note sheets; binder events do not require a submission. Please make one submission per team per event; if partners have different copies of the cheat sheet, upload both versions in the submission. If you update your notes, you should resubmit your note sheet to this form; we will only check the latest submission.</p>

<p><b>Academic Integrity Guide:</b> We have also created an academic integrity guide for both students and coaches to read, and that document can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vhsnbwgHFlcBDZ_vkUlkFTbN5cixNtqMfeSnWBDzPS4/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. Please make sure to read it in its entirety as it details our investigation procedures in the event that we suspect cheating has occurred. <b>All communication with teams regarding academic integrity will be done through coaches</b>, so please be sure to monitor your email regularly and respond in a timely manner if we have any inquiries. As a reminder, please do NOT communicate to any other competitors about any event information until after the awards ceremony (this includes posting on online platforms). There are a few teams competing in events after tournament day (2/12) so this is essential for ensuring fairness for all competitors. Competitors who violate this rule may be disqualified for one or more events.</p>

<p><b>Social Media:</b> Be sure to follow GGSO on all our social media platforms, so that you can stay up to date with the latest:</p>

  <li>Snapchat: <a target="_blank" href="https://snapchat.com/add/ggscioly">@ggscioly</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We will be having a series of contests, challenges, and giveaways on the day of the tournament and throughout the following week! Keep up with our social media for further details, updates, and announcements — you won’t want to miss it!</p>

<p><b>T-shirt Sale:</b> GGSO T-shirts are now on sale!

<h3>February 07, 2022</h3>

<h1 id="february-updates">February Updates</h1>

<p>Hello GGSO community,</p>

<p>I hope you all have been doing well! With the tournament less than a week away, we would like to provide you with one final update.</p>

<p>As a friendly reminder, the deadline for student rosters and release forms have passed, but if it has not already been completed, please do it as soon as possible. <b>All competing students must sign and submit the release forms in order to participate</b>. The “Verification/checklist” function on the Scilympiad for coaches should be activated, so you can check which students have submitted their release forms using that link on your dashboard. Additionally, registration payment is due in just a few days on <b>February 10th, 2022</b>, so please get them in soon.</p>

<p>With the change to a satellite format, we have compiled a <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15s4beEAVf4fmfHdjErVZjvQpTJpAtw2PjXpSSTBUjcE/edit">document</a> detailing all the event modifications. It includes instructions for video submissions and pre-tournament preparations (i.e. Machine Learning, Experimental Design, Forensics, and Write It Do It), as well as the <b>parameters for It’s About Time</b>. Again, teams without access to a school or gym space on tournament day should reach out via email to arrange an alternative time block. If you have reached out, you should have received an email last night (Sunday) with follow-up information. If you did not receive this email, please follow up again. Team numbers have been assigned on Scilympiad and can also be found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lQ7RcRiRQGmYeyipulkWe2KdQJE0HtLU_86MhBmytuQ/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. Self-scheduling for events will be open until <b>February 11 at 11:59 PM</b>. In last week’s email, we stated that teams from the same school have to select the same self-schedule slot, however we are revising this rule. <b>For Bridge, Ping Pong Parachute, and Wright Stuff, teams from the same school CAN sign up for different time slots. For Gravity Vehicle and Trajectory, teams from the same school will have to sign up for the same time slot. </b></p>

<p>Additionally, there was an issue on Scilympiad with coordinating payments and some teams were unable to sign-up. We have marked everyone as paid on Scilympiad so everyone should be able to complete self-sign up now (Under the green Sign-Up heading on the Head Coach Dashboard, there is a button named “Scheduled-Event Timeblocks.” This will redirect you to a page where there is a blue button labeled “Event Signup” which will then redirect you to where you can sign your teams up). Because of this change, we will be tracking payments on <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j-2ad82D2EDsKZtwZT7tYSTTKnhp-sINrTA4tTc0_k8/edit?usp=sharing">this</a> document, where you can find the status of your payment. If the information does not look accurate, please let us know.</p>

<p>As mentioned previously, we have made a Google Form through which students will submit their note sheets before the event starts, which can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/11rS66hjU2Sy0njrNnhmJTsd1cnLkL5SZKes-ln-VxPQ/edit">here</a>. Once again, this form is intended only for events with a limited number of note sheets; binder events do not require a submission. Please make one submission per team per event. If you update your notes, you should resubmit your note sheet to this form; we will only check the latest submission. All copies of the cheat sheets submitted will be deleted after the awards ceremony, which will be taking place on <b>Saturday, February 19, 2022 at 5 pm PT</b>. Its schedule is linked <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_hxhts2Zixuj8q-R1-h2yplQWhYeesoWBhYiLJyZyD0/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

<p>We understand that with this new format, communication between teams and tournament directors can be difficult. This year, <b>GGSO will have a <a target="_blank" href="https://stanford.zoom.us/j/95327809173?pwd=amt4V0tLbVd0eUN6Q215UG5YNjdUUT09">Zoom link</a> open from 8:30 am - 4:30 pm on tournament day, February 12, for any urgent questions/concerns regarding the tournament</b>. This zoom link is for <b>coaches only</b> - students should direct their questions to event supervisors and/or coaches first. Students and coaches can refer to our Day-of Tournament Troubleshooting <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RwFu7o9ulwN38wOhzgiJbcd3WqxK6dKm0yXTlSPJzYQ/edit?fbclid=IwAR1_L41ff1XKi-vKV7voq7AktFOgg0jxx70B5MyLgQWacAdy-P2j6xpWQ9g">guide</a> for common solutions to technical problems before contacting tournament directors. For any event-specific challenges/concerns, coaches can file an online appeal through Scilympiad as usual.</p>

<p>We have also created an academic integrity guide for both students and coaches to read, and that document can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vhsnbwgHFlcBDZ_vkUlkFTbN5cixNtqMfeSnWBDzPS4/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. Please make sure to read it in its entirety as it details our investigation procedures in the event that we suspect cheating has occurred. <b>All communication with teams regarding academic integrity will be done through coaches</b>, so please be sure to monitor your email regularly and respond in a timely manner if we have any inquiries.</p>

<p>Also, T-shirts are $12 dollars each and you can order them directly on CustomInk <a target="_blank" href="https://www.customink.com/g/nga0-00cj-6eeg">here</a>. Orders may be placed until competition day (February 12th) and will be shipped directly to you by CustomInk in early March. You are responsible for covering the shipping costs, so we encourage teams to place orders together to reduce the cost of shipping.</p>

<h1 id="reminder-updates">Reminder Updates</h1>

<p>Hello GGSO community,</p>

<p>I hope you all are doing well and staying safe! Since there have been a lot of changes in the tournament, we just wanted to give some reminders as well as important updates to keep all of the teams in the loop. Please read this email carefully for details about our tournament policy changes and clarifications.</p>

<p>First, the registration payment deadline has been extended to <b>February 10th, 2022</b>. Detailed instructions on how to complete that can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vun-pTePFyUxUCKyUN0xzP0jaIPDmauw9mMw1If_cxE/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. For teams that paid the full $200 registration fee, teams that paid via PayPal will be reimbursed through PayPal and those that paid via check will have to send a new check since we will default to shredding the original check. Again, if any team has an issue with this, please email us.</p>

<p>Student rosters and release form are due <b>February 4th, 2022</b>. Due to the shift to a Satellite format, we are asking head coaches to fill out and scan the additional Satellite Science Olympiad School Use Agreement and upload the form on Scilympiad under Documents. The form has been uploaded for Head Coaches under Scilympiad. In addition, <b>all competing students must sign and submit the Risk, Media, Covid release form in order to participate</b>.</p>

<p>An overview of the modifications for each event can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15s4beEAVf4fmfHdjErVZjvQpTJpAtw2PjXpSSTBUjcE/edit">here</a>, including instructions for video submissions and pre-tournament preparations (i.e. Machine Learning, Experimental Design, Forensics, and Write It Do It). Self-scheduling for events will be available on Scilympiad starting <b>tomorrow (2/1) at noon and will be open until February 11 at 11:59 PM</b>. If you signed up for slots that were open for the in-person tournament, please check again to ensure your teams are still signed up - the slot lengths have changed to reflect the new schedule and event modifications. Both teams from the same school must sign up for the same slot if applicable. Teams without access to a school or gym space on tournament day should reach out via email to arrange an alternative submission time. If you have reached out and we haven’t gotten back to you, please follow up to remind us. We’ll try our best to get back to you as soon as possible. Team numbers have been assigned on Scilympiad and can also be found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lQ7RcRiRQGmYeyipulkWe2KdQJE0HtLU_86MhBmytuQ/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

<p>As mentioned previously, ensuring the academic integrity of our tournament is of utmost importance. With this in mind, we are requiring students to <b>upload a PDF copy</b> of their final cheat sheet(s) through a Google form that we will send on a later date prior to the start of the tournament. This only applies to events with a limited number of cheat sheets (binders do not need to be submitted). A more detailed explanation of expectations and policies can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vhsnbwgHFlcBDZ_vkUlkFTbN5cixNtqMfeSnWBDzPS4/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. In all, students will NOT be allowed to use any other resources not outlined in the official rules.</p>

<p>The Awards Ceremony will be livestreamed on <b>February 19th</b>, one week after the tournament, and will start at 5pm PST. The link will be provided at a later date.</p>

<p>Also, T-shirts are $12 dollars each and you can order them directly on CustomInk <a target="_blank" href="https://www.customink.com/g/nga0-00cj-6eeg">here</a>. Orders may be placed until competition day (February 12th) and will be shipped directly to you by CustomInk in early March. You are responsible for covering the shipping costs, so we encourage teams to place orders together to reduce the cost of shipping.</p>

<h1 id="january-updates">January Updates</h1>

<p>Hello GGSO community,</p>

<p>We hope you all have been doing well! With the tournament right around the corner, we would like to provide you with several tournament updates and reminders. Please read this email carefully for details about our tournament policy changes.</p>

<p>Student rosters and release forms are due <b>February 4th, 2022</b>; students will not be able to compete without having these completed. Make sure that you have inputted information about your students on Scilympiad and then sent out emails to sign these forms. <b>All competing students must sign and submit this form in order to participate.</b></p>

<p>The registration payment deadline is <b>February 2nd, 2022</b>. Please include your school name in the payment and follow the other instructions detailed <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vun-pTePFyUxUCKyUN0xzP0jaIPDmauw9mMw1If_cxE/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. Regarding refunding for teams that paid the full $200 registration fee, teams that paid via PayPal will be reimbursed through PayPal. For teams that originally paid via check, we will default to shredding the original check and having your school send a new check. If any team has an issue with this, please email us.</p>

<p>Congratulations to Jacqueline for winning our T-shirt design competition! We had many stand-out submissions that were entered, so thank you to all those who submitted their amazing designs! GGSO T-shirts with her design are now on sale! T-shirts are $12 dollars each and you can order them directly on CustomInk <a target="_blank" href="https://www.customink.com/g/nga0-00cj-6eeg">here</a>. Orders may be placed until competition day (February 12th) and will be shipped directly to you by CustomInk in early March. You are responsible for covering the shipping costs, so we encourage teams to place orders together to reduce the cost of shipping.</p>

<p>We have updated our event schedule which can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tMKRDN0k8Tpf7kfq9fsDuSrwhSToJnWKrGSfbmWRB-c/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.

This year, we will also be running the trial event Machine Learning, the rules for which can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://www.soinc.org/sites/default/files/uploaded_files/Machine%20LearningC.PDF">here</a>. We are currently planning to run all of the build/engineering events as described in the rules, but primarily through submitting videos on the day of the tournament. Students will need to complete the event sometime during the available time blocks. If your school is unable to run these events on tournament day, please email us to discuss possible accommodations. More details about build events will be sent out in the following days, and announcements will be updated on our website and tournament plan.</p>

<p>Ensuring the academic integrity of our tournament is of utmost importance. For this reason, we are requiring students to <b>upload a PDF copy of their cheat sheet(s)</b> online through Google Forms <b>before the start of the tournament</b>. This upload must be a final copy, including any hand-written notes. This form will be released at a later time. This only applies to events with a limited number of cheat sheets (binders do not need to be submitted). Students will be able to have their own copy of their cheat sheets/binders for each event provided that each student’s copy is identical. Students will NOT be allowed to use any other resources not outlined in the official rules.</p>

<h3>January 18, 2022</h3>

<h1 id="registration-re-opening">Registration Re-opening</h1>

<p>Hello GGSO community,</p>

<p>I hope you are all staying safe and healthy. Given the current state of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have shifted our invitational to a Satellite-format tournament. Teams will compete synchronously on February 12, 2022, at their schools under the supervision of their coaches.</p>

<p>Due to this change, we will be expanding our tournament for up to 100 more teams for a total of 150 teams. Teams that are currently registered will remain registered. Teams originally on our waitlist must re-register for our tournament; we are disregarding our original waitlist. We will be opening up registration again on <b>January 20, 2022 at noon PDT</b> through Scilympiad. It will be on a first-come-first-served basis, and there will be a maximum limit of 150 teams, with a maximum of 2 teams per school.</p>

<p>The registration fee for this year’s tournament will be $55/team due by <b>February 2, 2022</b>, and can be paid through PayPal or via check. If registration costs prevent your school from competing, please reach out to us. Detailed information on how to register can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vun-pTePFyUxUCKyUN0xzP0jaIPDmauw9mMw1If_cxE/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

<h1 id="important-update">Important Update</h1>

<p>Hello GGSO community,</p>

<p>We hope you all enjoyed your winter break and are staying safe and healthy! With the tournament about a month away, we just wanted to give some important reminders and updates. First, we wanted to address the current state of the COVID-19 pandemic and how it will affect our tournament.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, after much discussion within our team and with the UC Berkeley event planning administration, <b>the 2022 GGSO tournament will now be online</b>. This was an extremely difficult decision for our team to make as we were all hopeful to have an in-person tournament this year. However, with the new Omicron variant and the rise in COVID-19 cases, we want to prioritize the health and safety of the GGSO competitors, coaches, and volunteers. Due to the uncertainty in the coming month, we wanted to make this decision at the earliest possible time in hopes of giving teams more time to adjust plans. We apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused your team, and please reach out if we can be of any assistance. We will release more information regarding the tournament details early next week.</p>

<p>With that being said, <b>the ESUS sign up scheduled for today will be cancelled</b>. We still ask that the final roster and student waivers should be completed no later than <b>January 26th at 11:59PM</b>.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, feel free to email us at goldengatescioly@gmail.com!</p>

<h1 id="important-tournament-date-update">Important Tournament Date Update</h1>

<p>Hello GGSO Community,</p>

<p>We have just been contacted by the Berkeley administration about changes in the campus room reservation. Unfortunately, due to these changes, we are now unable to secure the rooms needed to host our tournament in-person on February 19, 2022. We will be <b>postponing our registration</b> for up to a few weeks.</p>

<p>We are working to adapt our plan to the unexpected changes. We are currently communicating with the administration to secure facilities on a new tournament date. Tentatively, our new tournament date will be <b>Saturday, February 12, 2022</b>. As soon as we have confirmed the date, we will communicate our plan and registration details to you all.</p>

<p>We sincerely apologize for the sudden change and any inconvenience this may cause. Please be assured that we will be hosting an invitational this season. Thank you for your patience and understanding. As always, please contact us if you have any questions or concerns.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, feel free to email us at goldengatescioly@gmail.com!</p>

<h1 id="september-updates">September Updates</h1>

First and foremost, we have decided to host the tournament this year as a traditional in-person tournament. It will take place on <b>February 19, 2022</b> on the UC Berkeley campus. Students, parents, and coaches will be expected to follow COVID-19 guidelines placed to keep everyone safe, and we will make necessary precautions to prioritize the health of everyone. Due to the uncertainty of these times, the tournament format is subject to change, but we will keep everyone updated throughout the season.</p>

<h3>August 24, 2021</h3>

<h1 id="august-updates">August Updates</h1>

<p>Hello GGSO Community,</p>

<p>We hope that you all are doing well and staying safe during these times. As you may know, the Golden Gate Invitational takes place on UC Berkeley’s campus in the winter, and this season, we will host the tournament on <b>February 19, 2022</b>. However, due to many restrictions as well as the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are different possibilities of how the tournament will look this year. Please be assured that we will be hosting Golden Gate Invitational this season in some capacity in light of current events, and we are committed to prioritizing participants’ health and safety while maintaining the integrity of the competition and following the National Science Olympiad <a href="https://www.soinc.org/play/tournaments" target="_blank">guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>Depending on the circumstances, we have identified three different forms that GGSO could be in. The first is the traditional in-person tournament in which all teams compete on-campus. Though, if GGSO is unable to be held on-campus for everyone, we will run either a Satellite SO, in which students participate from their schools, or a Mini SO, in which students participate from their households.</p>

<p>Throughout these next months we will be operating amid great uncertainty. We ask for your flexibility, patience, and resilience as all of the unknowns create a challenging planning environment. Ultimately, we must be prepared to change the mode of the tournament at a moment’s notice and we will provide any and all relevant information as soon as possible. An initial guide of information detailing the specifics of our possible plans regarding the tournament can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQVGmN_3MEQ6Itsz2ROwvbAddOdRiaqE4b_-eD_IJK5l_8PsWplIxzu5YdfgVkhYfDg2bcm6bN7SbeT/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000" target="_blank">here</a>. We would like to gauge everyone’s interest in the possible tournament formats as well as have a place to bring up any questions or concerns about the tournament, so we ask that you fill out this quick <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd5nmbwjhPk-KxxuMHMlXeE9j5iyf5X0hFBJXcJDkcMxJXerg/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">survey</a> to make a more informed decision.</p>

<p>We look forward to having you participate in our tournament this upcoming season!</p>

<p>If you have any questions, feel free to email us at goldengatescioly@gmail.com!</p>
