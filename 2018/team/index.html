				<p>Hi! Over the course of 6 years, I competed for Winston Churchill Middle school and Mira Loma High school in Sacramento, CA. In those years, Science Olympiad became the most important influence on my collegiate and career choices leading me to where I am today. I hope to contribute to Science Olympiad to further impose the competition's positive influence on other students to help them discover their passions.</p>
