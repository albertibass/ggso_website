# January Updates

Hello GGSO community,

We hope you all have been doing well! With the tournament right around the corner, we would like to provide you with several tournament updates and reminders. Please read this email carefully for details about our tournament policy changes.

Student rosters and release forms are due <b>February 4th, 2022</b>; students will not be able to compete without having these completed. Make sure that you have inputted information about your students on Scilympiad and then sent out emails to sign these forms. <b>All competing students must sign and submit this form in order to participate.</b>

The registration payment deadline is <b>February 2nd, 2022</b>. Please include your school name in the payment and follow the other instructions detailed <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vun-pTePFyUxUCKyUN0xzP0jaIPDmauw9mMw1If_cxE/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. Regarding refunding for teams that paid the full $200 registration fee, teams that paid via PayPal will be reimbursed through PayPal. For teams that originally paid via check, we will default to shredding the original check and having your school send a new check. If any team has an issue with this, please email us.

Congratulations to Jacqueline for winning our T-shirt design competition! We had many stand-out submissions that were entered, so thank you to all those who submitted their amazing designs! GGSO T-shirts with her design are now on sale! T-shirts are $12 dollars each and you can order them directly on CustomInk <a target="_blank" href="https://www.customink.com/g/nga0-00cj-6eeg">here</a>. Orders may be placed until competition day (February 12th) and will be shipped directly to you by CustomInk in early March. You are responsible for covering the shipping costs, so we encourage teams to place orders together to reduce the cost of shipping.

We have updated our event schedule which can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tMKRDN0k8Tpf7kfq9fsDuSrwhSToJnWKrGSfbmWRB-c/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. As a reminder, events will be run synchronously and teams must compete in the time block specified. This year, we will also be running the trial event Machine Learning, the rules for which can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://www.soinc.org/sites/default/files/uploaded_files/Machine%20LearningC.PDF">here</a>. We are currently planning to run all of the build/engineering events as described in the rules, but primarily through submitting videos on the day of the tournament. Students will need to complete the event sometime during the available time blocks. If your school is unable to run these events on tournament day, please email us to discuss possible accommodations. More details about build events will be sent out in the following days, and announcements will be updated on our website and tournament plan.

Ensuring the academic integrity of our tournament is of utmost importance. For this reason, we are requiring students to <b>upload a PDF copy of their cheat sheet(s)</b> online through Google Forms <b>before the start of the tournament</b>. This upload must be a final copy, including any hand-written notes. This form will be released at a later time. This only applies to events with a limited number of cheat sheets (binders do not need to be submitted). Students will be able to have their own copy of their cheat sheets/binders for each event provided that each student’s copy is identical. Students will NOT be allowed to use any other resources not outlined in the official rules.
