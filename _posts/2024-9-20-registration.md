# Tournament Registration Announcement

Hi GGSO Community,

We hope you are doing well! We recently announced that our 9th annual Golden Gate Science Olympiad Invitational will take place on <b>Saturday, February 22nd, 2025</b>, and we now have an update on registration details.

Tournament registration will take place on <a target="_blank" href="https://scilympiad.com/golden-gate">Scilympiad</a>, and it will be open from <b>Saturday, September 28th, 2024 at 12:00PM PDT</b> until <b>Saturday, October 5th, 2024 at 12:00PM PDT</b>. This year, we will be holding registration on a first-come, first-serve basis, with a total of 60 spots available for teams. When registration is open, there will be an initial cap of one team per school and 50 spots available for different schools. If a school would like to register two teams, then its second team will automatically be placed on the waitlist, ordered based on the time at which the first team was registered. Any school that did not register within the first 50 slots will also be added to the waitlist as normal, regardless of whether it has a second team. After registration closes, we will take teams from the waitlist to fill the remaining 10 spots and additional spots that were not filled originally. A registration fee of $305 per team will be due by <b>November 1st, 2024</b>; further payment details and instructions will be sent out in a future update. For more information regarding registration policies, please see our <a target="_blank" href="https://goldengateso.com/details/">website</a>.

As a reminder, the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeFueIp8SwdBwxWy_5kEpb0RvPyDAwK7-90lm7aHwj3KdTSKA/viewform">t-shirt design contest</a> for GGSO 2025 is also officially open. All Science Olympiad community members are invited to submit a design by <b>November 1st, 2024</b>. The winning design will be printed on this seasonâ€™s t-shirts (plus the winner gets free merch!).

We will send a reminder email with additional details on registration logistics closer to when registration opens. In the meantime, please feel free to email us with any questions or concerns.
