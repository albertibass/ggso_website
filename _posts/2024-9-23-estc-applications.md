# Event Supervisor/Test Committee Applications

Hello GGSO Community,

We are releasing our Event Supervisor/Test Committee (ES/TC) application for the 2025 Golden Gate Invitational! Event Supervisors are responsible for writing the tests and supervising competitors on tournament day, whereas Test Committee members evaluate the test drafts prior to tournament day. These roles are only available to students who have graduated from high school. The link for the application can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://forms.gle/AbHd7x6zt34h5yHL9">here</a>, and the deadline to apply is <b>October 7th, 2024 at 11:59 PM PT</b>.


If you are interested in being a general volunteer for the tournament (grading tests under the guidance of an event supervisor), we will also be sending out an interest form for that soon. Thank you for your continued interest in running our tournament, and if you have any questions, please feel free to reach out!
