# Registration Reminder

Hello GGSO Community, 

This is a reminder that registration for this season’s Golden Gate Invitational opens today at <b>12:00PM PDT via <a target="_blank" href="https://scilympiad.com/golden-gate">Scilympiad</a></b>. For help with registering on Scilympiad, see <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jq3jVo8NdcEI5Iy9mQgXa3MByH-2AZXzX-0Q6B_1zYY/edit">this</a> step-by-step guide. Up to 2 teams per school may register and registration will be capped at 50 teams total—so sign up fast!

For registered teams, we do ask that the fee of <b>$225 per team is paid by November 1st, 2022</b>, either on Scilympiad through PayPal or via check. If the fee poses a problem for your team, please still register as planned and email us so we can find a solution.

Additionally, applications for Event Supervisor and Test Committee positions are open <b><a target="_blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/ggsoestc23">now</a></b>. The application is open to all non-competitiors, regardless of previous experience with Science Olympiad or GGSO. Applications for ES/TC will close on <b>October 2nd, 2022 at 11:59 PM PDT</b>.

Finally, as a general update regarding tournament format, we still expect to host GGSO <b>in-person at UC Berkeley on February 11th, 2023</b>.
