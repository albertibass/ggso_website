# September Updates

Hello GGSO Community,

I hope you all are having a great start of the school year and are staying safe and healthy. This email includes some important updates for our GGSO tournament. First and foremost, we have decided to host the tournament this year as a traditional in-person tournament. It will take place on <b>February 19, 2022</b> on the UC Berkeley campus. Students, parents, and coaches will be expected to follow COVID-19 guidelines placed to keep everyone safe, and we will make necessary precautions to prioritize the health of everyone. Due to the uncertainty of these times, the tournament format is subject to change, but we will keep everyone updated throughout the season.

Additionally, registration will open on <b>October 4, 2021 at noon PDT</b> and done through Scilympiad. It will be on a first-come first-served basis, and there will be a maximum limit of 50 teams, with a maximum of 2 teams per school.
