# Self-Scheduling Instructions

Hello GGSO community,

Self-scheduling for Bridge, Flight, Scrambler, Trajectory, and Mission Possible (trial) will open tomorrow, <b>January 18th, at 12PM PT via <a target="_blank" href="https://scilympiad.com/golden-gate">Scilympiad</a></b>. Instructions for self-scheduling can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16XgD4PrkHGkwtAloLoZpdZrFdYwSuJG3T8CZnnD-m5g/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a>

This is required for your team to compete in any of these 5 events; if your team isn’t competing in an event, there’s no need to self-schedule that event.

If you have any questions, feel free to email us at goldengatescioly@gmail.com!
