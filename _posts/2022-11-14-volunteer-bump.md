# Volunteer and T-shirts Reminder

Hello GGSO community,

This is a general reminder that we are still looking for volunteers for our 7th annual Golden Gate Invitational on February 11th, 2023. The details are below; please share them with fellow Stanford and UC Berkeley students who might be interested!

<b>Volunteer requirements</b>:
- <b>College/graduate student</b> from Stanford or UC Berkeley
- <b>Available to grade tests in-person</b> at UC Berkeley the weekend of the tournament
- <b>All experience levels welcome!</b> If you happen to have any Science Olympiad experience, relevant coursework, or knowledge applicable to one of our events, make sure to mention that in your application.

For all prospective volunteers, the <a target="_blank" href="https://forms.gle/GtabSzWDv7KMNz3L6">Tournament Volunteer Application</a> will be due <b>January 6th, 2023 at 11:59pm PDT</b>. Thank you for your time — GGSO wouldn’t be possible without your help!

Also, the deadline for our t-shirt design competition is coming up on <b>November 26, 2022 at 11:59pm PT</b>. Anyone (competitors or non-competitors) can submit designs to this form, and the winner will receive a free shirt!
