# Payment and Waiver Reminder

Hello GGSO community,

We wanted to remind you that the payment and waiver deadline for all teams registered for GGSO is <b>next Tuesday, November 1st</b> unless we’ve made alternate arrangements. If we don’t receive the registration fee and completed waivers by then, we may not be able to guarantee your team’s spot in our tournament. Please see steps 9-11 on our <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jq3jVo8NdcEI5Iy9mQgXa3MByH-2AZXzX-0Q6B_1zYY/edit?usp=sharing">Scilympiad guide</a> for payment instructions and step 13 for waiver instructions.

If this deadline poses an issue for your team, please reach out—we will do our best to find a solution! Let us know if you have any other questions.

If you have any questions, feel free to email us at goldengatescioly@gmail.com!
