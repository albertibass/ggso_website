# Event Update and Reminders

Hello GGSO community,

We wanted to provide some important reminders for deadlines and updates about the tournament. 

First, as mentioned before, there are many waivers and forms that need to be completed by <b>January 13, 2023</b>, so please ask the competitors to complete them as soon as they can. These forms include the <b>release waiver on Scilympiad</b>, a <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h-5iUA_1ZSv6WxVKOtsrgBnK7rUZBySo/view?usp=sharing">liability waiver</a>, a <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15w59XogXH7uaJEq-c72Jp1Vgq4vQc4FJ/view?usp=sharing">photo release form</a>, and a <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bW5_ZUqPLtS_kcHCLi1zcrQ6LWjZbIZ8/view?usp=sharing">consent to treatment of minor form</a>. For the photo release form, please distribute it to all minors who plan to attend the tournament in person and have them sign it. We ask that the last three forms from all the competitors be scanned and submitted as one PDF through this <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeYB9i25fPr6oxoTSFE0xNPB-zWQGyvyHcNxW8eoXqi4RsI3w/viewform?usp=sf_link">Google Form</a>.

We have finalized <b>team numbers</b> as well, so you can access them <a target="_blank" href="https://scilympiad.com/golden-gate/Sm/TeamRoster">here</a>. As a reminder, Mission Possible will be our trial event for this season, and we will be following the National level rules. Also, we are modifying Rocks and Minerals to be following National rules as well to provide a unique learning opportunity for the competitors. All other events will be held according to the Regional rules. For your convenience, we have linked the rules <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nIXkfy7aUxtm4_ljmC_-fdWFARAhQrYJ/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.
