# Event Modifications

Hello GGSO community,

We hope you all are doing well and getting excited for the holiday season! As we get closer to the tournament, we would like to just give some friendly reminders and updates. First, if you have not done so already, please <b>complete and submit the student release forms</b>. We also require that your competitors fill out these <b>additional forms</b>: a <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h-5iUA_1ZSv6WxVKOtsrgBnK7rUZBySo/view?usp=sharing">liability waiver</a>, a <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15w59XogXH7uaJEq-c72Jp1Vgq4vQc4FJ/view?usp=sharing">photo release form</a>, and a <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bW5_ZUqPLtS_kcHCLi1zcrQ6LWjZbIZ8/view?usp=sharing">consent to treatment of minor form</a>. We will be destroying these documents right after the tournament, just in case there is any concern about the information we are gathering. The deadline for all of these forms will be <b>January 13th, 2023</b> along with the release form on Scilympiad. 

Secondly, the <b>event list</b> can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jnOUybiRxWjM35YKs6WB2qQTcl1hEfwaW9ma99pNZ64/edit">here</a>. The <b>event schedule</b> along with the time blocks and some room assignments can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B_QA_xZmPuL3p5ZXWZEOfe5NuY2Im7bPj9elCecx1X4/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. This year, we will be holding Mission Possible for our trial event, and we will be following the National rules. Additionally, we will be modifying the Rocks and Minerals event to follow the National rules as well, since we gained access to some resources to make this possible. Keep in mind that we plan to have this portion less than 10% of the exam to make it fair for competitors. The rules are linked <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nIXkfy7aUxtm4_ljmC_-fdWFARAhQrYJ/view?usp=sharing">here</a> for your convenience. 

Lastly, due to some constraints in the building reservations, we will not be able to have spectators for Flight. However, the other build events listed on the event schedule will be open to spectators.
