# Plans for Saturday

Hello GGSO community,

The 2023 Golden Gate Science Olympiad Invitational is this Saturday, February 11th. We can’t wait to welcome you all to UC Berkeley!

This is one of our last announcements before tournament day (another coming the night before) so please read through the following items carefully.

- <b>Remind</b>: You can join our Remind group by using code @ggso2023, by texting @ggso2023 to the number 81010, or via <a target="_blank" href="https://www.remind.com/join/38kbh4">this</a> link. This will be our primary mode of communication on Saturday, and it’s also where you can ask us any and all questions as they come up.
- <b>Scilympiad Release Forms</b>: We are still missing this from at least one competitor on nearly all teams. This is crucial for students to participate, so please double check that everyone on your team(s) has filled it out. The release form link to send to competitors can be accessed by following step 13 on our <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jq3jVo8NdcEI5Iy9mQgXa3MByH-2AZXzX-0Q6B_1zYY/edit?usp=sharing">registration guide</a>; you can verify the form’s completion on the Student/Team/Event Assignment page.
- <b>Schedule</b>: See our tournament day schedule overview <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kp5OvwcZcO8H6DDXTakFtGhLU9Vbai9gtIHdqd4Ff-w/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.
    - Check-in will be at 8am in Kerr Lobby, where you will be able to pick up your <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FXUdXWjFEi0GLE-3T4lla1hXIr2670yW?usp=sharing">Coach Packet</a> that contains student wristbands (required for competitors), maps, etc. After checking in, head to your <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B_QA_xZmPuL3p5ZXWZEOfe5NuY2Im7bPj9elCecx1X4/edit#gid=739523940">homeroom</a> and settle in.
    - See the full <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B_QA_xZmPuL3p5ZXWZEOfe5NuY2Im7bPj9elCecx1X4/edit?usp=sharing">event schedule</a> for our impound and block schedule. It now contains a new sheet that outlines what times each team is assigned to for self-scheduled events (Bridge, Flight, Scrambler, Trajectory, Mission Possible). Please let us know ASAP if any conflicts come up regarding self-scheduling.
    - The Awards Ceremony will take place in Pauley Ballroom. Doors will open at 5:30pm, and due to space constraints we ask that only coaches and competitors attend. The ceremony will conclude by 7:30pm, after which coaches can pick up graded exams and score sheets from Tilden in MLK.
- <b>Scavenger Hunt</b>: If competitors have free time on their hands (like while waiting for the Awards Ceremony) and want to explore, we’re excited to announce our scavenger hunt challenge! Be on the lookout for more details via our Instagram account (@goldengatescioly) for the chance to win a free GGSO shirt. The first stop on our scavenger hunt is our social media booth in Wheeler Hall where competitors can find free stickers, a photo frame, and more information about some of our Stanford departmental sponsors. And in other social media news, the <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/fgP9YYxoFBM">GGSO Tournament Trailer</a> is out!
- <b>Logistics</b>:
    - The weather generally looks clear on Saturday, but please continue monitoring for any changes throughout the week—prepare accordingly for transporting devices, etc.
    - Parking locations can be found on <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1glofWxJTbxc1B3g5Lc8yoVqH5rBlXelc/view?usp=share_link">this</a> map (some may require a daily fee). Campus maps can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YYW2o2U0628UTScIqj_zKCLQS5ihZ3d5/view?usp=share_link">here</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/edit?mid=1x9ZScwyMU4d-PS1F-6hxtByDs42Ofqo&ll=37.87056059350552%2C-122.26232606881649&z=15">here</a>. For check-in, bus parking is first-come first-serve at West Circle/Crescent parking (cars cannot park in this lot), and there are also street parking and parking garage options all marked on the linked maps.
    - No food is allowed in homerooms, and homerooms must be vacated by 4:30pm. Unfortunately, we must enforce the food rule very strictly to avoid facing a $5,000 fine. Note that custodians will be monitoring the homerooms and checking trash bins for food waste. If the weather is as forecasted, we hope your team can grab a bite to eat outside instead—<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Og5nL5fKYhruK7-fapqulQJyaGy1yQvLocAuFsjOcgc/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> are some of our recommendations.
    - Free WiFi is available through CalVisitor.
    - Everyone must abide by the “never alone” policy, where there should never be a minor alone in a room with one adult at any time—nor should a minor ever be forced into a one-on-one situation with a volunteer, event staffer, or other adult. We take this very seriously; if you see a violation of this policy, notify headquarters in Wheeler immediately.
- <b>Event Updates</b>:
    - Flight will be tested in the RSF Fieldhouse which has dimensions 180’ x 114’ x 30’ (height). Teams are allowed to do practice flights in RSF during the Impound period.
    - Neither Flight nor Trajectory will allow spectators.
    - Scrambler will be run with the egg in a thin, transparent plastic bag.
    - Chemistry Lab, Experimental Design, Environmental Chemistry, and Forensics will all be run in Latimer Hall which is locked during the day. For these events, a volunteer will be there to let competitors in starting from 10 minutes before the event block begins till 10 minutes after it begins.
