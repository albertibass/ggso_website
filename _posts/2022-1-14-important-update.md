# Important Update

Hello GGSO community,

We hope you all enjoyed your winter break and are staying safe and healthy! With the tournament about a month away, we just wanted to give some important reminders and updates. First, we wanted to address the current state of the COVID-19 pandemic and how it will affect our tournament. 

Unfortunately, after much discussion within our team and with the UC Berkeley event planning administration, <b>the 2022 GGSO tournament will now be online</b>. This was an extremely difficult decision for our team to make as we were all hopeful to have an in-person tournament this year. However, with the new Omicron variant and the rise in COVID-19 cases, we want to prioritize the health and safety of the GGSO competitors, coaches, and volunteers. Due to the uncertainty in the coming month, we wanted to make this decision at the earliest possible time in hopes of giving teams more time to adjust plans. We apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused your team, and please reach out if we can be of any assistance. We will release more information regarding the tournament details early next week. 

With that being said, <b>the ESUS sign up scheduled for today will be cancelled</b>. We still ask that the final roster and student waivers should be completed no later than <b>January 26th at 11:59PM</b>.
