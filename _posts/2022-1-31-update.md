# Reminder Updates

Hello GGSO community,

I hope you all are doing well and staying safe! Since there have been a lot of changes in the tournament, we just wanted to give some reminders as well as important updates to keep all of the teams in the loop. Please read this email carefully for details about our tournament policy changes and clarifications.

First, the registration payment deadline has been extended to <b>February 10th, 2022</b>. Detailed instructions on how to complete that can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vun-pTePFyUxUCKyUN0xzP0jaIPDmauw9mMw1If_cxE/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. For teams that paid the full $200 registration fee, teams that paid via PayPal will be reimbursed through PayPal and those that paid via check will have to send a new check since we will default to shredding the original check. Again, if any team has an issue with this, please email us.

Student rosters and release form are due <b>February 4th, 2022</b>. Due to the shift to a Satellite format, we are asking head coaches to fill out and scan the additional Satellite Science Olympiad School Use Agreement and upload the form on Scilympiad under Documents. The form has been uploaded for Head Coaches under Scilympiad. In addition, <b>all competing students must sign and submit the Risk, Media, Covid release form in order to participate</b>.

An overview of the modifications for each event can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15s4beEAVf4fmfHdjErVZjvQpTJpAtw2PjXpSSTBUjcE/edit">here</a>, including instructions for video submissions and pre-tournament preparations (i.e. Machine Learning, Experimental Design, Forensics, and Write It Do It). Self-scheduling for events will be available on Scilympiad starting <b>tomorrow (2/1) at noon and will be open until February 11 at 11:59 PM</b>. If you signed up for slots that were open for the in-person tournament, please check again to ensure your teams are still signed up - the slot lengths have changed to reflect the new schedule and event modifications. Both teams from the same school must sign up for the same slot if applicable. Teams without access to a school or gym space on tournament day should reach out via email to arrange an alternative submission time. If you have reached out and we haven’t gotten back to you, please follow up to remind us. We’ll try our best to get back to you as soon as possible. Team numbers have been assigned on Scilympiad and can also be found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lQ7RcRiRQGmYeyipulkWe2KdQJE0HtLU_86MhBmytuQ/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. 

As mentioned previously, ensuring the academic integrity of our tournament is of utmost importance. With this in mind, we are requiring students to <b>upload a PDF copy</b> of their final cheat sheet(s) through a Google form that we will send on a later date prior to the start of the tournament. This only applies to events with a limited number of cheat sheets (binders do not need to be submitted). A more detailed explanation of expectations and policies can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vhsnbwgHFlcBDZ_vkUlkFTbN5cixNtqMfeSnWBDzPS4/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. In all, students will NOT be allowed to use any other resources not outlined in the official rules. 

The Awards Ceremony will be livestreamed on <b>February 19th</b>, one week after the tournament, and will start at 5pm PST. The link will be provided at a later date.

Also, T-shirts are $12 dollars each and you can order them directly on CustomInk <a target="_blank" href="https://www.customink.com/g/nga0-00cj-6eeg">here</a>. Orders may be placed until competition day (February 12th) and will be shipped directly to you by CustomInk in early March. You are responsible for covering the shipping costs, so we encourage teams to place orders together to reduce the cost of shipping.
