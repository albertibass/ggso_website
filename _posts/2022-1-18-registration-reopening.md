# Registration Re-opening

Hello GGSO community,

I hope you are all staying safe and healthy. Given the current state of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have shifted our invitational to a Satellite-format tournament. Teams will compete synchronously on February 12, 2022, at their schools under the supervision of their coaches.

Due to this change, we will be expanding our tournament for up to 100 more teams for a total of 150 teams. Teams that are currently registered will remain registered. Teams originally on our waitlist must re-register for our tournament; we are disregarding our original waitlist. We will be opening up registration again on <b>January 20, 2022 at noon PDT</b> through Scilympiad. It will be on a first-come-first-served basis, and there will be a maximum limit of 150 teams, with a maximum of 2 teams per school.

The registration fee for this yearâ€™s tournament will be $55/team due by <b>February 2, 2022</b>, and can be paid through PayPal or via check. If registration costs prevent your school from competing, please reach out to us. Detailed information on how to register can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vun-pTePFyUxUCKyUN0xzP0jaIPDmauw9mMw1If_cxE/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.
