# August Updates

Hello GGSO Community,

We hope that you all are doing well and staying safe during these times. As you may know, the Golden Gate Invitational takes place on UC Berkeley’s campus in the winter, and this season, we will host the tournament on <b>February 19, 2022</b>. However, due to many restrictions as well as the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are different possibilities of how the tournament will look this year. Please be assured that we will be hosting Golden Gate Invitational this season in some capacity in light of current events, and we are committed to prioritizing participants’ health and safety while maintaining the integrity of the competition and following the National Science Olympiad <a href="https://www.soinc.org/play/tournaments" target="_blank">guidelines</a>.

Depending on the circumstances, we have identified three different forms that GGSO could be in. The first is the traditional in-person tournament in which all teams compete on-campus. Though, if GGSO is unable to be held on-campus for everyone, we will run either a Satellite SO, in which students participate from their schools, or a Mini SO, in which students participate from their households. 

Throughout these next months we will be operating amid great uncertainty. We ask for your flexibility, patience, and resilience as all of the unknowns create a challenging planning environment. Ultimately, we must be prepared to change the mode of the tournament at a moment’s notice and we will provide any and all relevant information as soon as possible. An initial guide of information detailing the specifics of our possible plans regarding the tournament can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQVGmN_3MEQ6Itsz2ROwvbAddOdRiaqE4b_-eD_IJK5l_8PsWplIxzu5YdfgVkhYfDg2bcm6bN7SbeT/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000" target="_blank">here</a>. We would like to gauge everyone’s interest in the possible tournament formats as well as have a place to bring up any questions or concerns about the tournament, so we ask that you fill out this quick <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd5nmbwjhPk-KxxuMHMlXeE9j5iyf5X0hFBJXcJDkcMxJXerg/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">survey</a> to make a more informed decision. 

We look forward to having you participate in our tournament this upcoming season!
