# Tournament Logistics

Hello GGSO community,

It’s officially the month of our tournament! In preparation for the 2024 Golden Gate Science Olympiad Invitational on Sunday, February 11th, we would like to share some important tournament logistics.

You can view the <b>coaches packet</b> <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1S1YMMYoan-hnQ5KYI-FpvySmcmTb7j9h?usp=sharing">here</a>. Please review the coaches packet carefully and in its entirety. A summary of its contents is below:

<ol>
<li>
<b>Remind</b>: 
<br>
This will be our primary mode of communication during tournament day; we will use Remind to send updates and answer any questions you ask. To join our class, text the code <b>@ggso2024</b> to the number 81010 or input the code into the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.remind.com/join">join site</a>. A maximum of two coaches per team may join.
</li>
<br>
<li>
<b>Schedule</b>: 
<ul>
<li>Check-in begins at 8:00am in Kerr Lobby, where you will be able to pick up your coach packet that contains student wristbands (required for competitors) and all the information in the google drive folder linked above. After checking in, head to your <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fF4G8vO4ATYwSItFGesY_-NwTY0Hr0hyprXqBF1nz2k/edit">homeroom</a> and settle in.</li>
<li>See the full <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gxVAgVjbRbSAiikERalWiqyaS_E6fIj15B3Qfoa2NUM/edit#gid=72996862">event schedule</a> for our impound and block schedule. It now contains a new sheet that outlines what times each team is assigned to for self-scheduled events (Air Trajectory, Flight, Robot Tour, Scrambler, Tower, Cybersecurity). Please let us know ASAP if any conflicts come up regarding self-scheduling.</li>
<li>The <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ipww_9EE4_Ay3UI0MfnX9sybhQ2yGYFJrHSNfhe78YM/edit?usp=sharing">Awards Ceremony</a> will take place in Pauley Ballroom. Doors will open at 5:30pm, and, due to space constraints, we ask that only coaches and competitors attend. The ceremony will conclude by 7:30pm, after which coaches can pick up graded exams and score sheets from Wheeler 120.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br>
<li>
<b>Logistics</b>: 
<ul>
<li>The weather looks clear on Sunday, but please continue monitoring and prepare accordingly for transporting devices, etc.</li>
<li>The campus map can be viewed via <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PqZ47wFjHE8sWPEaSnvFrFwLjT_FROsv/view?usp=sharing">pdf</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/ggso24-map">Google Maps</a>. A parking map can be viewed <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tH0kzYbwg00ZDOkga-lL_8W8kEz06pUr/view?usp=sharing">here</a>. For check-in, bus parking is first come, first served at West Circle/Crescent parking (cars cannot park in this lot), and there are also street parking and parking garage options.</li>
<li>No food is allowed in homerooms, and homerooms must be vacated by 4:30pm. Unfortunately, we must enforce the food rule very strictly to avoid facing a $5,000 fine. Note that custodians will be monitoring the homerooms and checking trash bins for food waste. If the weather is as forecasted, we hope your team can grab a bite to eat outside instead—<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13HotOYhJANi3Hjx9B8ZtPxwlffYipdEAAi1xbJaDcpw/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> are some of our recommendations.</li>
<li>Sponsors can be found in Wheeler lobby starting at 10:00am. Feel free to speak with some of the organizations and departments sponsoring our tournament this year.</li>
<li>Free WiFi is available through CalVisitor.</li>
<li>Everyone must abide by the “never alone” policy, which states that there should never be a minor alone in a room with one adult at any time—nor should a minor ever be forced into a one-on-one situation with a volunteer, event staffer, or other adult. We take this very seriously; if you see a violation of this policy, notify headquarters in Wheeler immediately.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br>
<li>
<b>Event Update</b>: 
<br>
For Cybersecurity (trial event), the rules state that supervisors will provide a computer; however, we ask that competitors participating in Cybersecurity bring their own laptops. If this poses an issue, please let us know so we can make arrangements.
</li>
<br>
<li>
<b>Self-scheduled event sign-ups</b>:  
<br>
Sign-ups close at the <b>end of this week</b>, so please complete them ASAP.
</li>
</ol>

Thank you for reading through all these reminders and updates. As always, please don’t hesitate to reach out with any questions at goldengatescioly@gmail.com.
