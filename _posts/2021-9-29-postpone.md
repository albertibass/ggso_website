# Important Tournament Date Update

Hello GGSO Community, 

We have just been contacted by the Berkeley administration about changes in the campus room reservation. Unfortunately, due to these changes, we are now unable to secure the rooms needed to host our tournament in-person on February 19, 2022. We will be <b>postponing our registration</b> for up to a few weeks. 

We are working to adapt our plan to the unexpected changes. We are currently communicating with the administration to secure facilities on a new tournament date. Tentatively, our new tournament date will be <b>Saturday, February 12, 2022</b>. As soon as we have confirmed the date, we will communicate our plan and registration details to you all.

We sincerely apologize for the sudden change and any inconvenience this may cause. Please be assured that we will be hosting an invitational this season. Thank you for your patience and understanding. As always, please contact us if you have any questions or concerns. 

If you have any questions, feel free to email us at goldengatescioly@gmail.com!
