# Volunteer Applications

Hello GGSO Community,

We’re excited to host our 8th annual Golden Gate Invitational on Sunday, February 11th, 2024, and we are now looking for volunteers. Please spread the word to SciOly alumni and/or friends who might want to get involved!

Volunteer requirements:
- <b>College/graduate student</b> from Stanford or UC Berkeley. (We are happy to take volunteers not from these universities, but we cannot coordinate or reimburse transportation.)

- <b>Available to grade tests in-person</b> at UC Berkeley the weekend of the tournament.

- <b>All experience levels are welcome! </b> If you happen to have any Science Olympiad experience, relevant coursework, or knowledge applicable to one of our events, make sure to mention that in your application.


For those interested, the <a target="_blank" href="https://forms.gle/jLXymomfarJnWpvTA">Tournament Volunteer Application</a> will be due January 7th, 2024 at 11:59pm PST. As always, please feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions or concerns.

We also wanted to remind all GGSO community members of our <a target="_blank" href="https://forms.gle/Y9vW9taZW2RNj6dQ9">t-shirt design contest</a>; please submit your design by November 1st, 2023 at 11:59pm PDT to enter. Along with having their art featured on this year’s tournament shirt, the winner will receive a free shirt. We can’t wait to see your designs!

If you have any questions, feel free to email us at goldengatescioly@gmail.com.
