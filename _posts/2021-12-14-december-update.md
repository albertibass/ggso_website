# December Updates

Hello GGSO coaches,

I hope winter has been off to a great start for you all! As the tournament soon approaches, we would like to just give some friendly reminders and updates. First, if you have not done so already, please <b>complete and submit the student release forms on Scilympiad</b>. 

Secondly, the event list can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_xXjEtrDY8xdjcwQdFk3fikL239wQ5D1MAzGZ-X34to/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. The event schedule along with the time blocks and newly updated room assignments can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tMKRDN0k8Tpf7kfq9fsDuSrwhSToJnWKrGSfbmWRB-c/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. Due to time constraints for the buildings, we will not be having an impound for Wifi Lab. Devices will be inspected during the event blocks. We will be holding Ping Pong Parachute as a trial event outdoors. 

This year, we will also be running the trial event Machine Learning. The rules can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://www.soinc.org/sites/default/files/uploaded_files/Machine%20LearningC.PDF">here</a>. The ESUS sign up will be on <b>January 14th</b>, so make sure to mark your calendars. 

Thirdly, the deadline for the T-shirt design competition has been extended. Please submit your design to <a target="_blank" href="https://forms.gle/UyiBYbmBszvazCNr9">this</a> form by <b>December 26, 2021 at 11:59pm PST</b> to enter, and the winner of the contest will receive a GGSO t-shirt for free! We look forward to seeing your submissions! If you would like to pre-order the t-shirts, fill out <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfXqBEgvv6rQlRSz3Aw5IBuSudNLT0gmHE1Wp3UIFc6r-Wmkg/viewform?usp=sf_link">this</a> form by <b>December 26th</b>!

Lastly, we plan to hold the awards ceremony after the tournament from <b>6:30 - 8:00 PM</b>, so please plan your travel plans accordingly. Teams will be able to pick up tests and medals after the awards ceremony. If your team is unable to stay, we can ship medals with a fee.
