<b>Volunteer requirements</b>:

- <b>Available to grade tests in-person</b> at UC Berkeley the weekend of the tournament
- <b>All experience levels welcome!</b> If you happen to have any Science Olympiad experience, relevant coursework, or knowledge applicable to one of our events, make sure to mention that in your application.

For those interested, the <a target="_blank" href="https://forms.gle/GtabSzWDv7KMNz3L6">tournament volunteer application</a> will be due <b>January 6th, 2023 at 11:59pm PDT</b>. As always, please feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions or concerns.
