<h3>February 10, 2023</h3>

<h1 id="final-reminders">Final Reminders</h1>

<p>Hello GGSO community,</p>

<p>The 2023 GGSO Invitational is <b>tomorrow, February 11th!</b></p>

<p>This is our final announcement before tournament day. We have included new information at the top for convenience and reminders from previous announcements below.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Locations:</b> Some of the event rooms have been updated since we first sent out the event schedule, so please review <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qJJzyo8BQPmCtOJEbySli-TzUGC9-2pC/view?usp=sharing">this</a> document to see the most up to date locations. For some clarification on where some of these buildings are located, Bixby Commons North is in Latimer Hall and Kerr Lobby, Stephens, Tilden, Madrone, and Pauley are located in MLK Student Union. There will be signs to help direct competitors to the right location on the day of.</li>
  <li><b>Event Updates:</b>
    <ul>
      <li><b>WiFi Lab</b> will have a <b>maximum distance of 25 m</b> for competitors to test their antennas.</li>
      <li>For the lab events (Chemistry Lab, Environmental Chemistry, and Forensics), we will be running a hands-on lab portion. We will not be providing lab equipment for the competitors to use, so we <b>highly recommend bringing lab materials and equipment</b> to conduct this portion of the test. You can refer to <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N5vqOu4SD1lEmDxGaA5lShJcuOPXQCwo/view?usp=share_link">this</a> list of recommended materials.</li>
      <li>For the lab and build events, be sure to check the rules for what types of safety goggles and potentially lab aprons are required. <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ldV9ctESuGBR80Yd5IDfNUObAaSQSoCB/view?usp=sharing">This</a> document describes the different types of eye protection (different levels are permitted for different events).</li>
      <li>For events being held in the RSF Fieldhouse (Flight and Trajectory), there will be <b>competitor-only spectating</b>, meaning we will not allow any coaches, parents, or other individuals without wristbands to spectate. While we would love everyone to be able to watch, we want to abide by the Berkeley policies, and this system allows us to still have competitors spectate.</li>
      <li>Flight will be tested in the RSF Fieldhouse which has dimensions 180’ x 114’ x 30’ (height). We are allowing competitors to practice flights before the first event block.</li>
      <li>Scrambler will be run with the egg in a thin, transparent plastic bag.</li>
      <li>Chemistry Lab, Experimental Design, Environmental Chemistry, and Forensics will all be run in Latimer Hall which is locked during the day. For these events, you must come at least 5 minutes before or at most 10 minutes after the block starts since these large companies are visiting our class.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Remind:</b> You can join our Remind group with code @ggso2023, by texting @ggso2023 to the number 81010, or via <a target="_blank" href="https://www.remind.com/join/ggso2023">this</a> link. This will be our primary mode of communication on Saturday, and it’s also where you can ask us any and all questions as they come up.
    <ul>
      <li>For more urgent questions that you would like to speak to a tournament director in person, you can go to <b>Wheeler 222.</b></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Scilympiad Release Forms:</b> We are still missing this from at least one competitor on nearly all teams. This is crucial for students to participate, so <b>please double check that everyone on your team(s) has filled it out.</b> The release form link to send to competitors can be accessed by following step 13 on our <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jq3jVo8NdcEI5Iy9mQgXa3MByH-2AZXzX-0Q6B_1zYY/edit?usp=sharing">registration guide</a>; you can verify its completion on the Student/Team/Event Assignment page. If any of your competitors have not yet filled it out, they will not be able to compete.</li>
  <li><b>Schedule:</b> See our tournament day schedule overview <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kp5OvwcZcO8H6DDXTakFtGhLU9Vbai9gtIHdqd4Ff-w/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Check-in will be at 8am in Kerr Lobby (MLK), where you will be able to pick up your <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FXUdXWjFEi0GLE-3T4lla1hXIr2670yW?usp=sharing">Coach Packet</a> that contains student wristbands (required for competitors), maps, etc. After checking in, head to your <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B_QA_xZmPuL3p5ZXWZEOfe5NuY2Im7bPj9elCecx1X4/edit#gid=739523940">homeroom</a> and settle in.</li>

It now contains a new sheet that outlines what times each team is assigned to for self-scheduled events (Bridge, Flight, Scrambler, Trajectory, Mission Possible). Please let us know ASAP if any conflicts come up regarding self-scheduling.</li>
      <li>The Awards Ceremony will take place in Pauley Ballroom. Doors will open at 5:30pm, and due to space constraints we ask that only coaches and competitors enter. The ceremony will conclude by 7:30pm, after which coaches can pick up graded exams and score sheets from Tilden in MLK.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Scavenger Hunt:</b> If competitors have free time on their hands (like while waiting for the Awards Ceremony) and want to explore, we’re excited to announce our scavenger hunt challenge! Be on the lookout for more details via our Instagram account (@goldengatescioly) for the chance to win a free GGSO shirt. The first stop on our scavenger hunt is our social media booth in Wheeler Hall where competitors can find free stickers, a photo frame, and more information about some of our university departmental sponsors. And in other social media news, the <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/fgP9YYxoFBM">GGSO Tournament Trailer</a> is out!</li>
  <li><b>Logistics:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>The weather generally looks clear on Saturday, but please continue monitoring any changes throughout the week—prepare accordingly for transporting devices, etc.</li>
      <li>Parking locations can be found on <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1glofWxJTbxc1B3g5Lc8yoVqH5rBlXelc/view?usp=share_link">this map</a> (some may require a daily fee).

For check-in, bus parking is first-come first-serve at West Circle/Crescent parking (cars cannot park in this lot), and there is also street parking and parking garages all marked on the linked maps.</li>
      <li>No food is allowed in homerooms, and homerooms must be vacated by 4:30pm. Unfortunately, we must enforce the food rule very strictly to avoid facing a $5,000 fine. Note that custodians will be monitoring the homerooms and checking trash for food waste. If the weather is as forecasted, we hope your team can grab a bite to eat outside instead—<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Og5nL5fKYhruK7-fapqulQJyaGy1yQvLocAuFsjOcgc/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> are some of our recommendations.</li>
      <li>Free WiFi is available through CalVisitor.</li>
      <li>Everyone must abide by the “never alone” policy, where there should never be a minor alone in a room with one adult at any time—nor should a minor ever be forced into a one-on-one situation with a volunteer, a member of our event staff, or another adult.</li>

<h1 id="tournament-information">Tournament Information</h1>

<p>Hello GGSO community,</p>

<p>The Golden Gate Science Olympiad tournament is only eleven days away, and we’re looking forward to welcoming you next Saturday, February 11th at Berkeley.</p>

<p><b>Please read this carefully</b>, as it contains critical updates on the tournament schedule and day-of logistics.</p>

<p><b>Remind 101</b>: We use this text message remind service to send out critical day-of updates aimed primarily at coaches. Phone numbers are kept completely confidential by the website service, we promise not to send any updates after the tournament, and you can opt out at any time. <b>Our Remind101 system code is @ggso2023 this year, and you can join by texting @ggso2023 to the number 81010 or signing up with this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.remind.com/join/38kbh4">link</a>.</b></p>

<p><b>Forecast</b>: The weather forecast looks good for competition next Saturday, but be aware that the conditions may change. Please prepare accordingly, especially for events which require the transportation of impound creations. See the weather forecast for more specific information.</p>

<p><b>Day and event schedule</b>: An event schedule can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B_QA_xZmPuL3p5ZXWZEOfe5NuY2Im7bPj9elCecx1X4/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> and a general day schedule for the tournament has been posted online <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kp5OvwcZcO8H6DDXTakFtGhLU9Vbai9gtIHdqd4Ff-w/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Car Parking and Food</b>: Please check for parking at any of the locations in the parking <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1glofWxJTbxc1B3g5Lc8yoVqH5rBlXelc/view?usp=share_link">map</a>.
Note that some may require a daily fee. Food options we like can be found in this <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Og5nL5fKYhruK7-fapqulQJyaGy1yQvLocAuFsjOcgc/edit?usp=sharing">document</a>.</p>

<p><b>Morning Check-in</b>: Please check in to receive your coach packet (which includes last-minute information, maps, and student wristbands). Check-in will be run in <b>Kerr Lobby, beginning at 8 a.m.</b></p>

<p><b>Campus Map</b>: <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YYW2o2U0628UTScIqj_zKCLQS5ihZ3d5/view?usp=share_link">Here</a> is the map of campus, with the buildings that competitors will likely need to go to highlighted. We also have a digital map linked <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/edit?mid=1x9ZScwyMU4d-PS1F-6hxtByDs42Ofqo&amp;ll=37.87056059350552%2C-122.26232606881649&amp;z=15">here</a> to aid in directions. Please share this map with your teams as well. For additional navigation purposes, including walking to home rooms, events, and food locations, we recommend Google Maps. Previous tournament competitors have found this helpful.</p>

<p><b>Free wifi</b> is available on campus (connect to CalVisitor).</p>

<p><b>Homerooms</b>: Homerooms have been updated on this <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B_QA_xZmPuL3p5ZXWZEOfe5NuY2Im7bPj9elCecx1X4/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet</a> on the tab with the team numbers. These homerooms will open by 8:15am. You can also check where each of the events will take place on the event schedule.</p>

<p><b>Flight dimensions</b>: A rule mandates that all competitors for the event Flight must be provided with the dimensions of the room in which this event will take place. This room is called the RSF Fieldhouse, and its dimensions are: 180’ X `114’, with a ceiling height of 30’.</p>

<p><b>Scrambler details</b>: As mentioned in the rules, the event supervisors are allowed to place the egg in a thin transparent plastic bag. Our event supervisors have decided to do this, so we just wanted to give you all a heads ụp</p>

<p><b>Events in Latimer Hall</b>: This year, Latimer Hall (the building for Chem Lab, Experimental Design, Environmental Chemistry, and Forensics) will be locked during the day. However, a volunteer will be there to let competitors in 10 minutes before the event block is scheduled to start till 10 minutes after it starts.</p>

<p><b>Never alone policy</b>: As we have minors on campus, we are following a “never alone” policy. There must never be a minor alone in a room with one adult at any time. Correspondingly, at no point should a minor be forced into a one-on-one situation with a volunteer, a member of our event staff, or other adult. We take our commitment to this policy very seriously. If you see an ongoing violation of this policy, notify headquarters immediately.</p>

<p><b>Food Regulation Reminder</b>: NO FOOD IS ALLOWED IN HOMEROOMS. We agree that this is a ridiculous and frustrating rule, but Berkeley’s Event Services has alerted us several times that custodians will be on patrol through our reserved areas. Similar student groups have faced fines on the order of <b>$5000</b> for violating this rule. We’re hoping for great weather on Saturday, so we recommend a nice lunch outside or encourage students to visit any of the many cafes highlighted in the maps on our website.
Please consider the homerooms as a place to study and store equipment, but not a place to eat. Custodians will be passing by rooms as well as checking trash cans. No food should be brought back to or disposed of in homerooms.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we feel obligated to enforce this rule harshly, since a university violation would prevent future GGSO tournaments from being possible (and violating schools may share financial burden of any fines). Teams with food in their homerooms and trash cans face possible point deductions on their score and blacklisting from future GGSO events. We deeply apologize for this inconvenience but hope that it’s not too troublesome.</p>

<p><b>Sponsorship Booths</b>: The day schedule (above) includes information about the sponsorship booths in Wheeler Lobby. Stop by to speak with some of the organizations and departments sponsoring our tournament this year.</p>

<p><b>T-shirts</b>: This year, we ordered some extra GGSO t-shirts for competitors! A limited number of shirts will be available for $15 in Wheeler Lobby during the tournament, beginning at 10 a.m. (cash or check only).</p>

<p><b>Awards ceremony</b>: The awards ceremony will open to teams at 5:30 p.m. in Pauley Ballroom. Due to space constraints, chairs are reserved for coaches and competitors only, so no parents or other spectators. Seating will be on a first come first serve basis, and we ask that you do not move any of the chairs. The awards ceremony will conclude by 7:30 p.m., when coaches can then pick up tournament exams and score sheets from Tilden in MLK.</p>

<p><b>Other info</b>: Additional information about the tournament can be found in the coaches packet <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FXUdXWjFEi0GLE-3T4lla1hXIr2670yW?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Social Media</b>: We’re online! We’ll be posting fun tournament photos, updates, and live stories throughout the day to our Instagram (<b>@goldengatescioly</b>) account. Check us out!</p>

<p>If you have any questions, feel free to email us at goldengatescioly@gmail.com!</p>

<h1 id="january-updates">January Updates</h1>

<p>Hello GGSO community,</p>

<p>Happy New Year! We hope you and your team had a safe and restful winter break.</p>

<p>As we prepare for our invitational next month, we have a few general tournament reminders.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>January 9th</b>: Any schools interested in ordering a 2023 GGSO shirt should fill out the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfIML6dHWnxqMImytYyLpuuSc-ft_3kIShPT4yHW_LiUZAsXg/viewform?usp=sf_link">pre-order form</a> by this date. Shirts are $15 each and will be given to teams in-person on tournament day. Please email us if you’re unable to collect sizes on time!</li>
  <li><b>January 13th</b>: Competitor forms are due, including the <b>release waiver on Scilympiad</b>, a <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h-5iUA_1ZSv6WxVKOtsrgBnK7rUZBySo/view?usp=sharing">liability waiver</a>, a <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15w59XogXH7uaJEq-c72Jp1Vgq4vQc4FJ/view?usp=sharing">photo release form</a>, and a <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bW5_ZUqPLtS_kcHCLi1zcrQ6LWjZbIZ8/view?usp=sharing">consent to treatment of minor form</a>. Please submit the latter three forms as one combined PDF per team to this <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeYB9i25fPr6oxoTSFE0xNPB-zWQGyvyHcNxW8eoXqi4RsI3w/viewform?usp=sf_link">Google Form</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>For the Scilympiad release waiver, follow steps 12 and 13 on our <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jq3jVo8NdcEI5Iy9mQgXa3MByH-2AZXzX-0Q6B_1zYY/edit?usp=sharing">Scilympiad Guide</a>. Some teams have skipped step 12, so please ensure that you are assigning students to teams in addition to sending out the release form link. Let us know if Scilympiad is giving you trouble—we’re happy to help.</li>
      <li>For the photo release form, all individuals attending GGSO (coaches, competitors, any parent volunteers, other spectators, etc.) should fill this out. Minors can have the ‘Witnessed By’ section signed by their head coach.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>January 18th: Self-scheduling</b> for Bridge, Flight, Trajectory, Scrambler, and Mission Possible (trial) will open via Scilympiad at 12pm; instructions will be sent out closer to the sign-up date.</li>

Going forward, please email us directly rather than updating Scilympiad if you’d like to make any changes to your team name.
Note that only certain events (Bridge, Scrambler, and Trajectory) are open to spectators due to building restrictions.</li>
  <li><b>Event Reminders</b>: Both Rocks &amp; Minerals and Mission Possible (trial) will follow National rules. All other events will follow Regional rules.</li>

<p>Hello GGSO community,</p>

<p>We hope you all are doing well and getting excited for the holiday season! As we get closer to the tournament, we would like to just give some friendly reminders and updates. First, if you have not done so already, please <b>complete and submit the student release forms</b>. We also require that your competitors fill out these <b>additional forms</b>: a <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h-5iUA_1ZSv6WxVKOtsrgBnK7rUZBySo/view?usp=sharing">liability waiver</a>, a <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15w59XogXH7uaJEq-c72Jp1Vgq4vQc4FJ/view?usp=sharing">photo release form</a>, and a <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bW5_ZUqPLtS_kcHCLi1zcrQ6LWjZbIZ8/view?usp=sharing">consent to treatment of minor form</a>.

This year, we will be holding Mission Possible for our trial event, and we will be following the National rules. Additionally, we will be modifying the Rocks and Minerals event to follow the National rules as well, since we gained access to some resources to make this possible. Keep in mind that we plan to have this portion less than 10% of the exam to make it fair for competitors. The rules are linked <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nIXkfy7aUxtm4_ljmC_-fdWFARAhQrYJ/view?usp=sharing">here</a> for your convenience.</p>

<p>Lastly, due to some constraints in the building reservations, we will not be able to have spectators for Flight. However, the other build events listed on the event schedule will be open to spectators.</p>
