<h1 id="tournament-updates">Tournament Updates</h1>

<p>On behalf of Golden Gate Science Olympiad, we hope you’ve all had a good fall term and are looking forward to the upcoming holidays! We’ve been working over the past month to prepare for the upcoming 2017 Golden Gate Science Olympiad tournament, and our progress is detailed in the updates below. There’s a lot of critical information contained here, so please read carefully and note the action items at the bottom!</p>

<p><em>Team Numbers:</em> We’ve released our final list of registered teams on our website under “Tournament Details,” or linked <a href="http://goldengateso.com/doc/registered_teams.pdf">here</a>. This list includes team numbers. (The several teams with whom we are still working to secure payment have been marked with an asterisk, but this is slightly outdated. If you received a confirmation email, then we have you confirmed.)</p>

<p><em>Schedule:</em> We’ve released a <a href="http://goldengateso.com/doc/event_schedule.pdf">DRAFT</a> event schedule and <a href="http://goldengateso.com/doc/daily_schedule.pdf">daily</a> schedule on our website under “Tournament Details”. Please remember that these are both tentative, and we reserve the right to make any necessary changes should the university require us too. We will, however, make every effort to avoid any adjustments, and notify coaches ASAP should any occur. The event schedule very closely mirrors the national schedule, and will be updated in January to include room numbers. Events times marked “Online Schedule” will be selected online; see section below.</p>

<p><em>Event Sign Ups:</em> Event Sign Ups for online-scheduled events will open January 6th at 12:00pm (noon) PST. This will happen through the Mendel component of the Avogadro online software (see above). More info will be shared closer to Jan 6th.</p>

<p>If you are unfamiliar with sign-up events or new to Science Olympiad, please read on: While the majority of study and lab events are scheduled out by team number, certain events (marked as “Online Schedule”) will be running throughout the day in 10-minute time intervals. Coaches will go online and choose which of these 10 minute slots their team would like to compete in. This reduces scheduling conflicts for these events and allows students to run their engineering devices at the most convenient time. Slots are first-come first serve, opening Jan 6th.</p>

<p><em>Home rooms:</em> Each school will be assigned a spacious homeroom to use as a base for their teams. Schools may store food, devices, and other belongings here. Rooms will officially open at 7:30am, but may be open as early as 7am. Teams also have the option of setting up an outside “home base” on UC Berkeley’s Memorial Glade (bring your own Easy-Up tent and beware of weather!).</p>

<p><em>Avogadro:</em> We are using Avogadro &amp; Mendel to score our tournament and to schedule building events. Avogadro is the premier Tournament Management software for Science Olympiad tournaments.  Avogadro is the only web-based software that has been used at three National Science Olympiad Tournaments (2010, 2011 and 2016). Mendel is an add on to Avogadro that runs the event sign-up system. As coaches, there are a few things that you need to do to set up your team on Avogadro:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to <a href="http://v4.avogadro.ws">http://v4.avogadro.ws</a></li>
  <li>Create account if you don’t have one</li>
  <li>If you are coach, e-mail your username to <a href="mailto:goldengatescioly@gmail.com">goldengatescioly@gmail.com</a> so that your team(s) can be connected to the Avogadro user account you just created.</li>
  <li>We will let you know next steps once we get your username</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Evaluations Committee:</em> We’ve brought on board a team of 8 Stanford and UC Berkeley students who will form our 2017 Evaluations Committee! Their role will be to review the exams submitted by our Event Supervisors prior to the date of the competition, checking for appropriate rigor and formatting. They will work to ensure the tests are of national quality, but still approachable for teams just starting out. Check out their bios <a href="http://goldengateso.com/team/">here</a> on our website.</p>

<p><em>Forms:</em> Every attending minor must fill out two forms prior to the tournament. These forms were attached to an email sent to coaches, and should be printed and distributed to all minors (including competing students, alternates, and siblings that choose to attend as spectators) . We are asking that coaches then scan the stack of forms and upload the file to a Google Drive folder <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B9jwya8B9rv1clBRSHIzRV9NUUE">here</a> by January 13th. Each coach should create a folder for their team, and put the scanned pdf file in this folder. The forms may be submitted as a single pdf file or several, but a single is preferred. We will not require any paper copies to be submitted. If you haven’t worked with Google Drive before, consider asking a tech-savvy student to help you out! If you’re still having troubles, please reach out to us ASAP.</p>

<p><em>Awards Ceremony:</em> At the Closing Ceremony, medals will be awarded to the top 5 teams in each event, and trophies will be awarded to the top 6 overall schools. Additionally, due to space constraints at the venue, each team will only be guaranteed 19 seats at the closing ceremony. This includes the 15 team members. Competitors will use their wristbands to gain admission, and coaches will receive 4 additional entrance tickets at check-in. 15 minutes prior to the start of the ceremonies, any remaining seats will be opened on a first-come first-served basis. We regret having to enforce these limits on the audience, but this is simply an unavoidable factor of the resources available to us. Please warn any additional people traveling with your team in advance that they may be unable to attend the closing ceremony. We are currently investigating the possibility of live-streaming the event to an overflow room, and will follow up with that later on.</p>

<p><em>Regional Registration:</em> Just a reminder that every team participating in an invitational must be registered through their regional/state director. We’ve begun reaching out to check our team list, so if you haven’t yet signed up for your Regional competition, please do that ASAP.</p>
